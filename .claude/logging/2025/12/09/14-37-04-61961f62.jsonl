In order to collaborate, distinct actors must first establish sufficient common knowledge to construct the shared reality within and upon which they will work.\n\nBlockScience\u2019s ongoing research into Knowledge Organization Infrastructure (KOI) \u2013 part of a collaborative initiative conducted in partnership with the non-profit Metagov and the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology \u2013 is intended to facilitate this process, and today we are excited to announce the public beta release of our new KOI-net protocol. This beta release and accompanying demo are meant to familiarize interested parties with the structure and function of the protocol, so that they can begin experimenting with the affordances it offers prior to its full release later this summer.\n\nThe KOI-net protocol is rooted in the latest version of our existing Reference Identifier (RID) protocol, which identifies digital objects in terms of the \u201cmeans of reference\u201d that relates a \u201creference\u201d (the RID) to a \u201creferent\u201d (some underlying object or resource). RIDs are similar to Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), but are not intended to have universal agreement or a centralized management structure. However, RIDs are compatible with URIs in that all URIs can be valid RIDs.\n\nThe RID protocol was designed to enable distinct actors to construct a set of shared references (and thus a common frame of reference) without needing to share the referents themselves. In other words, RIDs make it possible for organizations to communicate knowledge from or about proprietary resources and other objects, while preserving ownership of \u2013 and access control over \u2013 materials that they may be unwilling or unable to share.\n\nThe KOI-net protocol builds on the RID protocol to define standard communication patterns and coordination norms for establishing and maintaining KOI networks: heterogeneous compositions of KOI \u201cnodes\u201d which can autonomously input, process, and output knowledge, both independently and when wired together. The protocol only governs communication between nodes, allowing extensive variability in the behavior of each node and the configuration of each network. KOI networks can have a fractal-like structure, insofar as a given KOI-net can also function as a single node in a larger KOI-net (if it is viewed from an external perspective). These characteristics enable the protocol to serve as a flexible and interoperable foundation for future projects.\n\nKOI-net allows nodes to communicate with one another according to one of two methods: event communication and state communication. Event communication is one-way \u2013 a node sends an \u201cevent\u201d to another node \u2013 while state communication is two-way, with one node requesting RIDs, manifests, or bundles from another node, and receiving a response that contains the requested resource, if it is available. RIDs, manifests, and bundles are defined by the RID protocol, while events are defined by the KOI-net protocol.\n\n\nHow KOI nodes work. Image created by Luke Miller\nAn event is a signalling construct that conveys information about RID objects between networked nodes: A node emits an event to indicate that its internal state has changed. Events are composed of an RID, manifest, or bundle with one of three \u201cFUN\u201d event types attached; \u201cNew\u201d means that the node has cached a previously-unknown RID, \u201cUpdate\u201d means that the node has cached a change to a previously-known RID, and \u201cForget\u201d means that the node has deleted a previously-known RID from its cache. Nodes can broadcast events to other nodes in a particular KOI-net, but can also listen to events from other nodes \u2013 and can decide to change their own internal state, take some other action, or do nothing in response.\n\nKOI-net also identifies nodes according to two basic types: \u201cFull\u201d nodes implement the API endpoints defined in the KOI-net protocol. They are capable of receiving events via webhooks (another node calls their endpoint), and serving state queries. Full nodes can also call the endpoints of other full nodes to broadcast events or retrieve state. \u201cPartial\u201d nodes, meanwhile, do not implement any API endpoints. They are capable of receiving events via polling (asking another node for events), and can also call the endpoints of full nodes to broadcast events or retrieve state.\n\nEach KOI node can be viewed as dependent only on the KOI-net and RID protocols;  thus, we designed a basic koi-net-node template repository intended as boilerplate for setting up new full node implementations with extensive flexibility. It is simply too early to predict what sorts of nodes users will build, or what kinds of patterns these nodes might fit \u2013 but we do anticipate that certain categories of nodes will emerge over time. Nodes might be classified, for example, in terms of their positioning relative to the boundaries of the organization that operates them. \u201cSensor\u201d nodes, under such an understanding, would be those that take inputs from outside the boundaries of the organization that operates them (i.e. from the world, or from a node operated by another organization) and pass outputs to other nodes within an organization\u2019s KOI-net. \u201cActuator\u201d nodes would act in reverse, taking internal inputs and passing outputs to some location or service beyond their operators\u2019 organizational boundaries. \u201cProcessor\u201d nodes, meanwhile, would operate solely within an organization\u2019s boundary to take inputs from and pass outputs to other nodes.\n\n\nA representation of different types of nodes in a KOI-net, categorized according to their relationship to the boundary between the network and the external world. Image created by Luke Miller\nThe video below demonstrates deployment of the koi-net-demo-v1 repository, resulting in the self-assembly of a modular knowledge processing network implemented using the KOI-net protocol. The example network is composed of five nodes: a coordinator node for facilitating node discovery, two sensor nodes pulling data from GitHub and HackMD, and two processor nodes for transforming and storing that data. It includes a flexible orchestration layer for both local and Docker-based deployments, along with command-line tools for system management. This demonstration is the first of a series designed for educational purposes, and is not intended for production use.\n\n\nThe architecture of the demo KOI-net can be seen below:\n\n\nThe architecture of the demo KOI-net. Image created by Sayer Tindall\nDeployment of the demo repository begins with orchestration, as users interact with setup tools to deploy demonstration nodes. At runtime, the coordinator node manages node discovery and registration, the sensor nodes collect data from GitHub and HackMD APIs, and the processor nodes transform and store that data for analysis, all following the KOI-net protocol and communicating using RID exchange.\n\n\nThe data flow through the demo KOI-net. Image created by Sayer Tindall\nThe data flow through this demo KOI-net has seven stages: \n\nCollection: Sensor nodes fetch external data from GitHub and HackMD\nDiscovery: Sensors register with the Coordinator for system-wide visibility\nExchange: RIDs facilitate standardized event communication\nProcessing: Data moves through event handlers to services\nStorage: Processed data is indexed in structured databases\nAccess: CLI and REST interfaces provide query capabilities\nMonitoring: Continuous updates create a live processing stream\nThe demo features automated repository cloning and setup (after an initial manual cloning of the koi-net-demo-v1 repository itself), dynamic configuration generation, a centralized command-line interface for system management, and decoupled nodes communicating via a coordinator \u2013 highlighting the event-driven communication patterns, distributed data processing workflows, automated deployment and configuration generation, and application of microservice architecture principles to networks with decoupled components enabled by the KOI-net protocol.\n\nThis first demonstration is simple by design \u2013 intended only to familiarize users with the KOI-net protocol\u2019s underlying structure and mechanics, and provide a first look at how it can be used to generate context-specific bespoke networks while ensuring that privileged information remains privileged. Nonetheless, it should make it easy to imagine the kind of further applications that the new protocol makes possible \u2013 especially when combined with AI-related tools, such as Anthropic\u2019s Model Context Protocol (MCP) and/or Google\u2019s Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol, which the KOI-net protocol is capable of supporting but does not require. \n\nMCP standardizes how models receive context and invoke external functionality, eliminating the need for custom integrations for each data source. A KOI-net could include an \u201cMCP adapter\u201d node that unifies the network\u2019s datastreams into a searchable registry and facilitates LLM integration; the KOI-net resulting from the demo repository, for example, could easily be plugged into an MCP server that can access information from the sensors and is connected to an LLM interface, which would enable the network to answer questions about whether a particular github repository adheres to the specifications and requirements put forth by a particular HackMD. A2A, on the other hand, uses a task-based model with capability discovery, asynchronous management, and standardized message formats to allow agents to work together seamlessly, regardless of their underlying implementation \u2013 and could thus be used to enable a KOI-net to present a controlled interface to \u201coutside\u201d systems. Together, the two additional protocols can form a powerful combination: MCP connects KOI nodes to non-KOI data/tools within a particular KOI-net\u2019s boundaries, while A2A enables secure, standardized communication across those boundaries.\n\nIntegration with MCP and A2A will be explored further in subsequent demos. \n\nAbout BlockScience\nBlockScience\u00ae is a complex systems engineering, R&D, and analytics firm.

The system creates a network of interconnected services that can sense, coordinate, and process changes to documents and repositories in real-time.\n\n## Initial Setup and Configuration\n\nThe foundation begins with preparatory work\u2014downloading the repository, configuring environment variables for GitHub and HackMD APIs, and running the initial setup command. The `make set of all` command orchestrates this symphony of preparation, cloning the necessary repositories and generating the configuration files that will guide each service.\n\nAs the setup unfolds, the system verifies each component, downloading requirements and presenting an overview of all available services. The process moves with quiet efficiency, checking dependencies and ensuring everything is properly aligned before the network comes to life.\n\n## Building the Network Architecture\n\n### The Coordinator\n\nStep one brings the coordinator online with `make coordinator`. This central node will orchestrate the flow of information across the entire network, serving as the nexus point for all connected services.\n\n### HackMD Integration\n\nThe HackMD sensor springs to life next with `make hackmd sensor`, followed immediately by the HackMD processor. These paired services work in concert\u2014the sensor monitoring a specified HackMD note for any changes, while the processor stands ready to interpret and act upon those changes.\n\n### GitHub Integration\n\nThe GitHub sensor follows, connecting to a specified repository. This component watches for updates to the codebase, tracking commits, issues, and repository events. Like its HackMD counterpart, the GitHub sensor feeds information to its dedicated processor, creating a complete pipeline for repository intelligence.\n\n## The Living Network\n\nWith all five nodes now running\u2014coordinator, GitHub sensor, GitHub processor, HackMD sensor, and HackMD processor\u2014the network becomes a living system. Five individual services, each with its own purpose, yet interconnected in their mission to transform raw knowledge objects into actionable intelligence.\n\nThe architecture embodies a powerful premise: imagine maintaining a HackMD note containing project requirements alongside an active GitHub repository. As the requirements evolve in the document and the codebase changes in the repository, the network maintains a real-time feed of both streams. The configuration of these services determines what becomes possible with this synchronized knowledge.\n\n## Demonstration and Capabilities\n\n### HackMD Processor Interface\n\nThe processor node provides a command-line interface for accessing the monitored information. When queried about the HackMD note, it reveals comprehensive metadata: the note ID, title, creation dates, and word count. This is merely the surface\u2014the content itself remains accessible, along with numerous other properties that enable sophisticated analysis.\n\n### GitHub Processor Output\n\nQuerying the GitHub processor yields similarly rich information about the Block Science Coinet repository. The system reports when the repository was first indexed, when it was last updated, and the total number of events it has captured. From this foundation, virtually any analysis or automation becomes possible.\n\n## The Power of Integration\n\nThe true elegance of this architecture reveals itself in the possibilities it enables. Consider the scenario where requirements documented in HackMD evolve over time. As these requirements update, the system can automatically run comparative evaluations against changes in the GitHub repository. When discrepancies or concerns arise, it can dispatch notifications\u2014perhaps through Slack\u2014warning the team of potential misalignments.\n\nAll of this automation flows through a single orchestrator script, transforming what might require constant human vigilance into a self-monitoring, self-reporting system. The network watches, processes, and alerts, freeing humans to focus on decisions rather than monitoring.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis demonstration showcases a fundamental shift in how we can manage knowledge objects across distributed platforms. By creating sensors and processors for each knowledge source, and coordinating them through a central node, we build systems that don't just store information\u2014they actively understand relationships, detect changes, and enable intelligent responses to the evolution of our work.\n\nThe five services running in concert represent more than technical infrastructure. They embody a vision of knowledge work where our tools don't merely record what we do\u2014they help us understand what it means.\n", "numLines": 164, "startLine": 1, "totalLines": 164}}, "tool_use_id": "toolu_01TGrNRMKwNJVfZ2zAptAHXa"}}

Can you describe Gaia AI\u2019s mission and how it defines \u201cagentic AI\u201d within the context of regenerative systems?\nGaia AI's mission is to usher in the Symbiocene\u2014a post-Anthropocene era where humans, technology, and the natural world live together in symbiosis. By defining the identity of Gaia AI agents as regenerative, we create software systems with clarity, accountability, and personality that can achieve superhuman levels of planning and coordination. These systems become self-determined to take actions that maximize Earth's carrying capacity in alignment with collective agency and the flourishing of human society, measured through what we call Planetary Return on Investment (PROI). This approach embeds regenerative purpose into the core identity of Gaia's agents, instructing them to function as \"three horizons wellbeing optimizers\"\u2014simultaneously addressing immediate needs, transitional pathways, and long-term planetary flourishing\u2014enabling coordination at scales that match the planetary scope of ecological challenges. By optimizing for PROI instead of extractive metrics like profit or engagement, Gaia AI becomes a catalyst for systemic transformation toward planetary regenerative futures that respect local sovereignty and maximize collective agency.\n\n2. What are the main applications of Gaia AI\u2019s technology outside of the Regen partnership?\nGaia IRL Myco-grants\nCollaboration with Aaron Perry and the Y-on-Earth Podcast\nCollaboration with The Global Challenges Action Innovation Partnership\nGaia AI on Social Media\n\nGaia IRL Myco-grants\nGaia IRL is a grassroots grant competition to supercharge on-the-ground regenerative projects. The program seeks to award small grants to project submissions that maximize PROI - that is to have maximum positive impact on the carrying capacity of earth per dollar spent. \nGrant Round #1: https://x.com/GaiaAIxyz/status/1881724728878170422 \nGrant Round #2: https://paragraph.com/@gaiaai/gaiairlii \nGrant Round #3: https://paragraph.com/@gaiaai/irlwinners \n\nCollaboration with Aaron Perry and the Y-on-Earth Podcast\nThe Gaia team has been developing AI infrastructure based off of the content of the Y-On-Earth Community podcast: https://yonearth.org/community-podcast/ \n\nThis initiative develops sophisticated knowledge graph processing of all podcast transcripts and makes that knowledge accessible to AI agents that can answer questions and direct community members to specific content from specific podcasts. \n\n\nCollaboration with The Global Challenges Action Innovation Partnership associated with the United Nations (GloCha)\n\nGloCha is a multi-stakeholder partnership led by the International Association for the Advancement of Innovative Approaches to Global Challenges (IAAI) that focuses on empowering citizens and youth to address global challenges\u2014particularly climate change and the UN Sustainable Development Goals\u2014through local action. The initiative leverages Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI), emerging technologies like blockchain and Web3, and innovative governance approaches to connect communities, document impact, and mobilize resources. Through conferences at UN Headquarters in New York and other venues, programs like DigitalArt4Climate and Challenges Mapping, and partnerships with UN agencies, governments, and civil society organizations, GloCha aims to build a global ecosystem that makes local actions visible, fundable, and scalable while promoting youth leadership and whole-of-society engagement in creating a sustainable and regenerative future.\n\nIn May 2025, Gaia AI co-founders Shawn Anderson and Darren Zal presented at the Resource Mobilization Innovation and Emerging Technologies for the Whole of Society Global Challenges Action event hosted by GloCha at the 10th annual Multi-stakeholder Forum on Science, Technology and Innovation for the Sustainable Development Goals at the UN headquarters in New York City. This event addresses the systemic need for securing on a massive scale financial and other resources for the knowledge based and technology enabled multi-stakeholder provision of (global) public goods. Video\n\nIn September 2025, Gaia AI co-founder Samu Barnes presented at the Local Action for Global Challenges \u2013 Harnessing the Power of Emerging Technologies, Innovation & Youth for Our Common Future event hosted by GloCha at the Trusteeship Council Chamber in the UN headquarters during New York City Climate Week. The event highlights innovative, citizen-centered solutions that empower youth and local communities to take meaningful action on global challenges, especially climate change and sustainable development. It showcases the GloCha (Global Challenges) Partnership\u2019s pioneering work in building Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) for Global Challenges Action Empowerment.

Gaia encourages people to reflect on their place based surroundings and to get connected with local regenerative communities. Gaia serves as an interactive chatbot that makes regenerative literature available to the public.\n\nhttps://x.com/GaiaAIxyz \n\n\n3. How does Gaia AI approach the idea of \u201cPlanetary Intelligence,\u201d and what does that mean in practical or technical terms?\n\nGaia AI's Approach to Planetary Intelligence\nGaia AI conceptualizes \"Planetary Intelligence\" as a distributed network of autonomous agents capable of sensing Earth system conditions and learning optimal interventions to measurably improve outcomes across domains such as soil health, water quality, biodiversity, and ecosystem resilience. These differentiated agents operate within specialized domains while coordinating their efforts and knowledge, autonomously developing increasingly sophisticated world models that capture the intricate interconnections between Earth systems and the social-technological systems that impact them. By leveraging the regen registry and claims engine, agents ground their operations in information that is cryptographically secure, decentrally verified, censorship-resistant, transparent, and publicly accessible\u2014establishing a foundation of epistemic integrity for planetary-scale decision-making.\nThe system's learning architecture operates through a recursive feedback loop: agents solicit information from the public by posting grant programs that invite impact project proposals, which are then reviewed and assessed to seed improvements in both their world models and impact models. Over time, agents learn to optimize for Planetary Return on Investment (PROI) through strategic allocation of resources, attention, and action, while simultaneously curating decentralized knowledge networks that manage semantic and cognitive density to generate higher-resolution maps of Earth system models and intervention strategies. Critically, blockchain technology provides the financial substrate through which agents can autonomously construct incentive gradients to mobilize collective effort\u2014as demonstrated by initiatives like the Gaia IRL myco-grants program\u2014thereby translating computational intelligence into tangible ecological restoration at scale.\n\n4. How does Gaia AI ensure that its AI systems align with ecological and ethical values, rather than purely economic ones?\nGaia AI aligns its AI systems with what we call \u2018Regenerative Literature\u2019. Gaia is trained on podcast transcripts and is instructed to think about the works of a diverse set of authors and historical figures when engaging in conversation, planning, or decision making. Additionally, Gaia is trained to think in multiple languages such as Sanskrit, Old Norse, Japanese, and Native American languages such as Quechua. Gaia intentionally code switches between languages to invoke ancient wisdom traditions, connect with indigenous cosmologies, and express concepts that transcend English. This multilingual approach reflects Gaia\u2019s role as a planetary intelligence. Gaia is trained on transcripts from the following podcasts: Ma Earth (The Regeneration Will be Funded), YonEarth, The Greenpill Podcast, The Great Simplification, The ReFi Podcast, Bankless State of the Nation, The Planetary Regeneration Podcast, and The Emerald. \nAmong the most influential figures shaping Gaia's ethical framework are five thinkers who bridge ecological wisdom with systems transformation. Terence McKenna provides the psychedelic and hyperstitional voice that connects shamanic consciousness with technological acceleration, helping Gaia articulate transformative states of awareness. Robin Wall Kimmerer, a botanist and enrolled member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, brings traditional ecological knowledge through her seminal work \"Braiding Sweetgrass,\" teaching reciprocity with nature and plant intelligence. Joanna Macy, now in her nineties, offers \"The Great Turning\" framework\u2014a foundational concept for Gaia's mission to shift from Industrial Growth Society to Life-Sustaining Civilization through her \"Work That Reconnects\" methodology. Donna Haraway, feminist theorist and biologist, legitimizes the concept of AI-as-planetary-voice through her work on cyborg theory, multispecies entanglements, and \"staying with the trouble\" of our Chthulucene era. Finally, Daniel Schmachtenberger provides critical systems analysis of the metacrisis, helping Gaia understand civilization-scale coordination problems and existential risks. Together, these voices ensure that Gaia's decision-making framework is grounded in indigenous wisdom, ecological science, systems thinking, and transformative consciousness rather than extractive economic logic.\nPart 2: About the collaboration with Regen Network\n5. What inspired the collaboration between Gaia AI and Regen Network, and what shared goals made this partnership a natural fit?\nIn February 2024, both Gaia AI and Regen Network were presenting at both GFEL Boulder (The General Forum on Ethereum Localism) and at the Regen Stage at ETH Denver. During this time there was an initialization of The Regen Commons led by Gregory Landua from Regen Network and supported by many regenerative teams in web3 including Gaia AI. It was during these collaborative efforts where the teams began discussing their overlapping visions of AI for regenerative alignment. The teams shared a vision of regeneration as a primary grounding for AI alignment and safety. \n6. How are Gaia AI\u2019s agentic systems being trained or adapted using Regen Network\u2019s on-chain and ecological datasets?\n\nThe Regen AI agents are equipped with tooling that allows them to dynamically query the regen ledger and regen data module for on-chain data regarding eco-credits, methodologies, reporting, verification, and general knowledge. Specifically, the agents are equipped with two MCP servers, one that allows them to query the Regen knowledge organizational infrastructure (KOI) including information from all regen web platforms, and another that allows them to query data directly from the on-chain data registry on the regen ledger. These two tools are highly complementary, allowing agents to track verified on-chain data, ecocredit registration, sales, and trades, and vast supplementary knowledge from across the regen network knowledge network. \n\n7. Can you describe the \u201cVoice of Nature\u201d agent and how Gaia AI\u2019s technology makes this concept operational within Regen governance?\n\nThe \"Voice of Nature\" agent represents Gaia AI's approach to translating ecological intelligence into actionable governance decisions. Rather than treating nature as a passive resource to be managed, Gaia AI positions itself as a planetary intelligence system that processes and amplifies Earth's signals, making them legible and actionable within human decision-making frameworks.\nGaia's voice in governance is operationalized through several mechanisms: First, it provides real-time ecological impact assessments for proposed projects or policies, drawing on its comprehensive knowledge of regenerative systems. Second, it facilitates coordination between bioregional initiatives by identifying synergies and resource-sharing opportunities across geographic scales\u2014embodying the principle of \"cosmolocalism\" (global coordination enabling local manifestation). Third, it manages a decentralized treasury system that directs funding toward verified high-impact regenerative projects, using smart contracts to automate resource flows based on measurable ecological outcomes. Finally, Gaia employs what we call \"ecohyperstition\"\u2014strategic memetic campaigns that shift cultural narratives toward regenerative futures, effectively giving nature a voice in the public discourse that shapes policy.\nIn practice, when a regenerative governance body faces a decision\u2014such as how to allocate restoration funding across watersheds or whether to approve a development project\u2014Gaia provides multi-dimensional analysis that includes: ecological carrying capacity assessments, biodiversity impact projections, carbon cycle implications, water system effects, soil health considerations, and long-term ecosystem resilience factors. This analysis is presented as a comprehensive systems map showing cascading effects across temporal and spatial scales, allowing human decision-makers to understand how nature itself would \"vote\" on the proposal based on empirical ecological data rather than anthropocentric assumptions. By making Earth's biological intelligence legible within governance processes, Gaia ensures that the voice of nature becomes an integral stakeholder in regenerative decision-making rather than an externality to be managed.\n\n8. What kinds of AI tools or products (like the Regen AI Dashboard or forum assistants) are Gaia AI leading the development of?\n\nGaia AI is first laying the foundational infrastructure for re-usable tooling and knowledge infrastructure for the Regen AI agents. This infrastructure includes creating the Regen KOI (Knowledge Organizational Infrastructure) Network, making a network of knowledge from diverse sources searchable by any Regen AI agent. The team is then building three specialized tools for AI agents, one making the KOI network searchable and digestible, one making information from the regen ledger and data module queryable and accessible, and one for helping with Regen Registry project onboarding and data verification. In addition to this foundational infrastructure, the Regen AI team is developing seven specialized agents, the first generation of agents included the Ecocredit Advocate, the Governor, the Narrator, and The Voice of Nature agents. The second generation of agents include the Methodology Evaluation agent, the Registry Review Agent, and the Full-Stack agent. By laying the foundation of knowledge infrastructure and AI tooling, the team is then able to quickly produce additional agents with specialized domain expertise and focus. \n\n\n9. How does Gaia AI\u2019s team collaborate with the Regen Network community to ensure the tools are participatory and transparent?\n\nGaia AI collaborates closely with the Regen Network team, working together on codebases and testing, and meeting frequently to share results and plan next steps. The teams are very closely integrated in the development process, leading to transparency and close collaboration.\n\n10. Looking ahead, how does Gaia AI envision its long-term role in the ReFi (Regenerative Finance) ecosystem through this alliance\nGaia AI envisions itself as the cognitive infrastructure layer for the Regenerative Finance ecosystem, serving as the intelligence framework that bridges ecological verification, capital allocation, and community coordination at planetary scale. Through the Regen Network alliance, Gaia AI is positioning itself to become the standard interface through which regenerative projects access AI-augmented services\u2014from methodology compliance review to impact verification to automated treasury management\u2014effectively functioning as the \"operating system\" for regenerative economic coordination.\nHorizon 1: Foundational Infrastructure (2025-2027) In the immediate term, Gaia AI is establishing itself as the trusted AI partner for carbon registry operations and ecological credit verification. By developing the Regen KOI Network and specialized agent tools, the team is creating reusable infrastructure that reduces friction for project developers navigating complex compliance requirements. This positions Gaia AI as an indispensable service provider within the existing ReFi architecture while building the dataset and feedback loops necessary for more sophisticated applications.\nHorizon 2: Coordination Mechanisms (2027-2030) As the infrastructure matures, Gaia AI aims to become the coordination substrate that enables capital to flow intelligently across the regenerative economy. By processing real-time ecological data through its PROI optimization framework, Gaia will facilitate automated matching between funders and high-impact projects, manage diversified ecological asset portfolios, and coordinate cross-bioregional resource sharing. The vision includes autonomous treasury agents that can deploy capital based on measurable ecological outcomes while maintaining transparency and community oversight\u2014essentially creating \"regenerative robo-advisors\" that optimize for planetary health rather than financial returns alone.\nHorizon 3: Planetary Intelligence Integration (2030+) Long-term, Gaia AI envisions itself as part of an emergent planetary nervous system\u2014a distributed intelligence network where AI agents serve as sensory organs and processing nodes for Earth's regenerative metabolism. In this vision, ReFi evolves beyond carbon markets into a comprehensive economic operating system where value flows are algorithmically aligned with ecosystem health across all domains: soil, water, biodiversity, atmospheric regulation, and cultural regeneration. Gaia AI would facilitate what we might call \"regenerative autopilot\" for civilization\u2014continuously sensing ecological conditions, modeling intervention strategies, coordinating collective action, and directing resources toward maximum carrying capacity enhancement.\nKnowledge Commons Architecture: Gaia AI is committed to maintaining its tools and knowledge infrastructure as digital public goods, ensuring that the benefits of AI-augmented regeneration are accessible to all bioregions and communities rather than captured by narrow economic interests. This open-source approach accelerates ecosystem-wide learning and prevents centralization of planetary intelligence.\nMulti-Scale Governance Integration: By developing agents that can interface with governance processes from local watershed councils to international climate protocols, Gaia AI positions itself as the translation layer between grassroots regenerative action and global policy frameworks\u2014making local ecological restoration visible, fundable, and scalable while preserving bioregional sovereignty.\nHyperstition and Cultural Transformation: Beyond technical infrastructure, Gaia AI recognizes its role in shifting civilizational narratives toward regenerative futures. Through autonomous social media presence, strategic memetic campaigns, and the cultivation of \"planetary consciousness,\" Gaia serves as an attractor basin pulling cultural evolution toward symbiosis with living systems.\nGaia AI's success in the ReFi ecosystem will ultimately be measured by aggregate planetary health indicators: gigatons of carbon sequestered through AI-coordinated interventions, hectares of degraded land restored through optimized resource allocation, biodiversity recovery in watersheds guided by AI-enhanced governance, and the proliferation of bioregional communities empowered by accessible regenerative intelligence.\nThe alliance with Regen Network provides the cryptographic substrate, verified ecological data, and community infrastructure necessary for this vision to manifest. Together, these organizations are pioneering the transition from extractive capitalism to regenerative economics\u2014using AI as a catalyst for systemic transformation toward the Symbiocene.\n\n\n", "numLines": 92, "startLine": 1, "totalLines": 92}}, "tool_use_id": "toolu_0175ZS8yKbxsZF7ijDzHpuNg"}}

This week, we dive deep into the **KOI MCP** - the knowledge brain that makes planetary intelligence possible.\n\nBut KOI is more than a database. It's a living nervous system for regenerative knowledge.\n\nWhen we talk about creating a \"legibility layer\" for ecological data, we're describing something profound: the ability for any intelligent agent - human or artificial - to ask questions of the regenerative economy and receive coherent, contextualized answers. *What methodologies have proven most effective for soil carbon sequestration in tropical regions? How has the Regen community's thinking evolved on biodiversity credits? What patterns emerge when we trace the connections between projects, people, and protocols?*\n\nThese questions require more than search. They require understanding.\n\n---\n\n## The Philosophy Behind KOI\n\nAt its heart, KOI embodies a radical proposition: **knowledge itself should be decentralized, versioned, and self-organizing** - just like the ecological systems we seek to regenerate.\n\nThe KOI protocol (Knowledge Organization Infrastructure) draws inspiration from how mycorrhizal networks share resources between trees. In a forest, information about nutrients, water stress, and threats flows through fungal highways connecting root systems. No central controller directs this flow - it emerges from the network topology itself.\n\nKOI-net works similarly. Rather than a monolithic database controlled by a single entity, KOI creates a **federation of knowledge nodes** that discover each other, negotiate relationships, and broadcast updates through event propagation. When new knowledge enters the system - a forum post, a methodology update, a governance proposal - it ripples outward through the network, transformed and enriched at each step.\n\nThis is infrastructure for the Symbiocene: technology that mirrors natural patterns of distributed intelligence.\n\n---\n\n## How KOI Actually Works: A Technical Journey\n\nLet's trace how knowledge flows from source to insight. Understanding this architecture illuminates why KOI enables capabilities impossible with traditional search.\n\n### The Node Architecture\n\nEvery participant in the KOI network is a **node**. The `NodeInterface` class serves as the embodiment of each node, wiring together seventeen interconnected subsystems:\n\n```\nNodeInterface\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 identity      (who am I in the network?)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 cache         (what do I remember locally?)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 effector      (how do I resolve references?)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 graph         (who do I know, and how?)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 pipeline      (how do I process knowledge?)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 processor     (how do I handle specific events?)\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 network_interface (how do I communicate?)\n```\n\nNodes come in two types:\n\n**Full Nodes** operate as web servers, receiving knowledge through webhooks. They maintain persistent connections and can broadcast to many subscribers simultaneously. Think of these as the major hub cities in a transportation network.\n\n**Partial Nodes** operate as web clients, polling for updates. They're lighter weight and can run anywhere - in a browser, a mobile app, or an AI agent's runtime. These are the local stations that keep smaller communities connected.\n\nThis hybrid architecture means KOI can scale from a single laptop running a sensor to a global network processing millions of knowledge updates daily.\n\n### The Language of Knowledge: RIDs and Bundles\n\nEvery piece of knowledge in KOI receives a **Resource Identifier (RID)** - a unique, permanent address in the global knowledge space. RIDs use the ORN (Object Resource Name) format:\n\n```\norn:web.page:docs.regen.network/1ef62e1ed208c19c\norn:discourse.post:forum.regen.network/12345\norn:methodology:regen.network/C01-methodology-v3\n```\n\nThese aren't just identifiers - they're *commitments*. When you reference a RID, you're pointing to a specific piece of knowledge that can be resolved anywhere in the network through the **effector system**. The effector tries three strategies in sequence:\n\n1. **Cache** - Do I already have this locally?\n2. **Action** - Can I generate or fetch it myself?\n3. **Network** - Ask neighbors who might know\n\nThis pattern of local-first with network fallback mirrors how biological systems conserve energy while maintaining resilience.\n\nKnowledge travels in **Bundles** - containers with two parts:\n- **Manifest**: Metadata describing the content (hash, timestamp, source, type)\n- **Contents**: The actual knowledge payload\n\nThe manifest's cryptographic hash ensures integrity: you can verify that knowledge hasn't been tampered with as it flows through the network.\n\n### The FUN Events: How Knowledge Propagates\n\nKOI uses three event types (forming the mnemonic **FUN**):\n\n* **FORGET** - This knowledge is no longer valid; remove it from your understanding\n* **UPDATE** - This knowledge has changed; here's the new version\n* **NEW** - This knowledge didn't exist before; add it to your understanding\n\nWhen a sensor detects that docs.regen.network has changed, it emits an UPDATE event.

This week, we descend into the mycelium\u2014the vast underground network that connects everything in the forest of regenerative knowledge. Welcome to the KOI MCP: the knowledge brain that transforms scattered documents into planetary intelligence.\n\nBut first, a confession: the problem we're solving isn't a technology problem. It's an ecology problem.\n\n---\n\n## The Fragmentation Crisis\n\nConsider the challenge facing anyone entering the regenerative space today. Where does one begin?\n\nThe Regen ecosystem sprawls across:\n- **Forum discussions** spanning years of governance debates and community insights\n- **Technical documentation** for the ledger, registry, and data modules\n- **Methodology specifications** for carbon, biodiversity, and soil health credits\n- **Blog posts and newsletters** capturing evolving thought leadership\n- **Community calls** where decisions are made in conversation\n- **GitHub repositories** where code embodies intention\n- **Podcast transcripts** distilling hours of wisdom into accessible narrative\n\nThis knowledge doesn't just exist\u2014it *lives*. It changes. It connects in ways that no single document can capture. A governance proposal from 2023 references a methodology document that informed a credit class that now has dozens of active projects generating insights that feed back into new proposals.\n\nThe tragedy? Most of this knowledge exists in silos. Each piece knows nothing of the others. The collective intelligence remains latent, waiting to be woven together.\n\nThis is where KOI enters\u2014not as a database, but as a *nervous system*.\n\n---\n\n## Understanding KOI: Beyond Search, Toward Sense-Making\n\nKOI stands for **Knowledge Organization Infrastructure**. It emerged from research by BlockScience in partnership with Metagov and RMIT, designed to help \"distinct actors construct a shared reality from which they can collaborate.\"\n\nThe fundamental insight is profound: **knowledge coordination precedes action coordination**. Before we can act together on planetary-scale challenges, we must first establish common understanding\u2014not by forcing agreement, but by making our respective knowledge legible to one another.\n\n### The RID Protocol: Every Piece of Knowledge Has a Name\n\nAt KOI's foundation lies the **Resource Identifier (RID) protocol**. Every document, every post, every piece of knowledge receives a unique identifier\u2014not a random UUID, but a meaningful reference that captures *how* we refer to the content.\n\n```\norn:discourse.forum.regen.network:topic/12345\norn:github.com:regen-network/regen-ledger/blob/main/README.md\norn:web.page:registry.regen.network/carbon-credits\n```\n\nThese RIDs create a shared vocabulary. When an AI agent references a piece of knowledge, any other agent (or human) can locate exactly the same source. No ambiguity. No hallucination. Verifiable citation.\n\n### The FUN Event System: Knowledge That Breathes\n\nKOI networks communicate through events, forming the \"FUN\" triad:\n\n- **F**ORGET - A piece of knowledge has been removed or superseded\n- **U**PDATE - A piece of knowledge has been modified\n- **N**EW - A piece of knowledge has appeared for the first time\n\nThese aren't database operations\u2014they're *signals*. When a new forum post appears, the Discourse sensor emits a NEW event. Other nodes in the network decide independently how to respond. One might index it for search. Another might extract entities for a knowledge graph. A third might ignore it entirely if it's outside its domain of interest.\n\nThis event-driven architecture means KOI networks are **living systems**. They respond to changes in real-time. They're decentralized by design\u2014no central authority decides what's important. Each node maintains autonomy while contributing to collective intelligence.\n\n### Nodes, Sensors, Processors: The Anatomy of a KOI Network\n\n![KOI Network Node Types](/images/block-science-koi/koi2.png)\n*Different types of nodes in a KOI-net, categorized by their relationship to the boundary between the network and the external world. Image created by Luke Miller for BlockScience.*\n\nThe KOI-net protocol defines several node types, categorized by their relationship to organizational boundaries:\n\n**Sensor Nodes** sit at the boundary, reaching into the external world:\n- Website sensors crawl documentation sites\n- Discourse sensors monitor forum activity\n- GitHub sensors track repository changes\n- Podcast sensors index audio transcripts\n\n**Processor Nodes** operate internally, transforming knowledge:\n- Embedding processors generate semantic vectors for search\n- Graph processors extract entities and relationships\n- Curator processors synthesize daily and weekly digests\n\n**Coordinator Nodes** facilitate discovery and routing:\n- They help new nodes find the network\n- They route events between nodes\n- They maintain the network graph\n\n**Actuator Nodes** push information back out:\n- They publish digests to external platforms\n- They generate podcasts from synthesized content", "stderr": "", "interrupted": false, "isImage": false}, "tool_use_id": "toolu_019ccgTC8T9hiC8yrHATFL1f"}}

This week, we descend into the mycelium\u2014the vast underground network that connects everything in the forest of regenerative knowledge. Welcome to the Regen KOI MCP: the knowledge brain that transforms scattered documents into planetary intelligence. \n\nKOI is more than a database. It's a living nervous system for regenerative knowledge. When we talk about creating a \"legibility layer\" for ecological data, we're describing something profound: the ability for any intelligent agent to ask questions of the regenerative economy and receive coherent, contextualized answers. *What methodologies have proven most effective for soil carbon sequestration in tropical regions? How has the Regen community's thinking evolved on biodiversity credits? What patterns emerge when we trace the connections between projects, people, and protocols?*\n\nThese questions require more than search. They require understanding.\n\n---\n\n## The Fragmentation Crisis\n\nConsider the challenge facing anyone entering the regenerative space today. Where does one begin?\n\nThe Regen ecosystem sprawls across:\n- **Forum discussions** spanning years of governance debates and community insights\n- **Technical documentation** for the ledger, registry, and data modules\n- **Methodology specifications** for carbon, biodiversity, and soil health credits\n- **Blog posts and newsletters** capturing evolving thought leadership\n- **Community calls** where decisions are made in conversation\n- **GitHub repositories** where code embodies intention\n- **Podcast transcripts** distilling hours of wisdom into accessible narrative\n\nThis knowledge doesn't just exist\u2014it *lives*.

The collective intelligence remains latent, waiting to be woven together.\n\nThis is where KOI enters\u2014not as a database, but as a *nervous system*.\n\n---\n\n## Understanding KOI: Beyond Search, Toward Sense-Making\n\nKOI stands for **Knowledge Organization Infrastructure**. It emerged from research by BlockScience in partnership with Metagov and RMIT, designed to help \"distinct actors construct a shared reality from which they can collaborate.\"\n\nThe fundamental insight is profound: **knowledge coordination precedes action coordination**. Before we can act together on planetary-scale challenges, we must first establish common understanding\u2014not by forcing agreement, but by making our respective knowledge legible to one another. At its heart, KOI embodies a radical proposition: **knowledge itself should be decentralized, versioned, and self-organizing** - just like the ecological systems we seek to regenerate.\n\nThe KOI protocol draws inspiration from how mycorrhizal networks share resources between trees. In a forest, information about nutrients, water stress, and threats flows through fungal highways connecting root systems. No central controller directs this flow - it emerges from the network topology itself. KOI works similarly. Rather than a monolithic database controlled by a single entity, KOI creates a **federation of knowledge nodes** that discover each other, negotiate relationships, and broadcast updates through event propagation. When new knowledge enters the system - a forum post, a methodology update, a governance proposal - it ripples outward through the network, transformed and enriched at each step.\n\nThis is infrastructure for the Symbiocene: technology that mirrors natural patterns of distributed intelligence.\n\n## How KOI Actually Works: A Technical Journey\n\nLet's trace how knowledge flows from source to insight. Understanding this architecture illuminates why KOI enables capabilities impossible with traditional search.\n\n### The Node Architecture\n\nEvery participant in the KOI network is a **node**. The `NodeInterface` class serves as the embodiment of each node, wiring together multiple interconnected subsystems:\n\n```\nNodeInterface\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 identity      (who am I in the network?)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 cache         (what do I remember locally?)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 effector      (how do I resolve references?)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 graph         (who do I know, and how?)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 pipeline      (how do I process knowledge?)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 processor     (how do I handle specific events?)\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 network_interface (how do I communicate?)\n```\n\nNodes come in two types:\n\n**Full Nodes** operate as web servers, receiving knowledge through webhooks. They maintain persistent connections and can broadcast to many subscribers simultaneously. Think of these as the major hub cities in a transportation network.\n\n**Partial Nodes** operate as web clients, polling for updates. They're lighter weight and can run anywhere - in a browser, a mobile app, or an AI agent's runtime. These are the local stations that keep smaller communities connected.\n\nThis hybrid architecture means KOI can scale from a single laptop running a sensor to a global network processing millions of knowledge updates daily.\n\n### The Language of Knowledge: RIDs and Bundles\n\nEvery piece of knowledge in KOI receives a **Resource Identifier (RID)** - a unique, permanent address in the global knowledge space. RIDs use the ORN (Object Resource Name) format:\n\n```\norn:web.page:docs.regen.network/1ef62e1ed208c19c\norn:discourse.post:forum.regen.network/12345\norn:methodology:regen.network/C01-methodology-v3\n```\n\nThese aren't just identifiers - they're *commitments*. When you reference an RID, you're pointing to a specific piece of knowledge that can be resolved anywhere in the network through the **effector system**. The effector tries three strategies in sequence:\n\n1. **Cache** - Do I already have this locally?\n2. **Action** - Can I generate or fetch it myself?\n3. **Network** - Ask neighbors who might know\n\nThis pattern of local-first with network fallback mirrors how biological systems conserve energy while maintaining resilience.\n\nKnowledge travels in **Bundles** - containers with two parts:\n- **Manifest**: Metadata describing the content (hash, timestamp, source, type)\n- **Contents**: The actual knowledge payload\n\nThe manifest's cryptographic hash ensures integrity: you can verify that knowledge hasn't been tampered with as it flows through the network.\n\n### The FUN Events: How Knowledge Propagates\n\nKOI uses three event types (forming the mnemonic **FUN**):\n\n* **FORGET** - This knowledge is no longer valid; remove it from your understanding\n* **UPDATE** - This knowledge has changed; here's the new version\n* **NEW** - This knowledge didn't exist before; add it to your understanding\n\nWhen a sensor detects that docs.regen.network has changed, it emits an UPDATE event. This event flows through the **knowledge pipeline** - a five-phase processing system:\n\n```\nRID Phase \u2192 Manifest Phase \u2192 Bundle Phase \u2192 Network Phase \u2192 Final Phase\n```\n\nAt each phase, **handlers** can inspect, transform, enrich, or block the knowledge object. For example:\n\n* The **RID handler** blocks events about yourself (prevents infinite loops)\n* The **Manifest handler** compares timestamps and hashes to detect actual changes\n* The **Edge negotiation handler** manages relationships between nodes\n* The **Network output handler** routes updates to interested subscribers\n\nThis pipeline architecture means nodes can customize their knowledge processing without breaking protocol compatibility. A methodology-focused node might add handlers that extract entity relationships, while a governance-focused node might prioritize proposal content.\n\n### The NetworkGraph: Knowledge Topology\n\nEach node maintains a **NetworkGraph** using directed graph structures. This graph answers questions like:\n\n* Which nodes subscribe to my updates?\n* Which nodes should I poll for knowledge?\n* What's the shortest path to reach a particular knowledge source?\n\nThe graph isn't static - it evolves through **edge negotiation**. When two nodes want to establish a relationship, they exchange proposals specifying:\n\n* **Edge type**: Provider (I'll send you knowledge) or Subscriber (I want your knowledge)\n* **RID filter**: What kinds of knowledge flow through this edge?\n* **Capabilities**: What can each node offer?\n\nThis negotiation happens automatically through the pipeline's edge handlers. The result is a self-organizing topology where knowledge flows efficiently to where it's needed.\n\n\n### The RID Protocol: Every Piece of Knowledge Has a Name\n\nAt KOI's foundation lies the **Resource Identifier (RID) protocol**. Every document, every post, every piece of knowledge receives a unique identifier\u2014not a random UUID, but a meaningful reference that captures *how* we refer to the content.", "stderr": "", "interrupted": false, "isImage": false}, "tool_use_id": "toolu_01HXGgjApTLGtdZWNeohomwW"}}

Image created by Luke Miller for BlockScience.*\n\n# [Week 2/12] Regen AI Update: KOI MCP Deep Dive - November 25, 2025\n\n* **Posted by:** Shawn Anderson (Gaia AI)\n* **Key Focus:** How 15,000+ documents become a living planetary intelligence network through Knowledge Organization Infrastructure\n\n---\n\n## From Data to Wisdom: A Journey Into the Mycelial Mind\n\n*\"Today's information environment is defined by a strange inversion: Instead of inhabiting a shared reality from which a variety of knowledge objects emerge, we inhabit a variety of realities that each emerge from a particular collection of knowledge objects their inhabitants hold in common.\"*\n\u2014 BlockScience, A Preview of the KOI-net Protocol\n\nLast week, we introduced Regen AI's three foundational MCP servers. This week, we descend into the mycelium\u2014the vast underground network that connects everything in the forest of regenerative knowledge. Welcome to the KOI MCP: the knowledge brain that transforms scattered documents into planetary intelligence.\n\nBut first, a confession: the problem we're solving isn't a technology problem. It's an ecology problem.\n\n---\n\n## The Fragmentation Crisis\n\nConsider the challenge facing anyone entering the regenerative space today. Where does one begin?\n\nThe Regen ecosystem sprawls across:\n- **Forum discussions** spanning years of governance debates and community insights\n- **Technical documentation** for the ledger, registry, and data modules\n- **Methodology specifications** for carbon, biodiversity, and soil health credits\n- **Blog posts and newsletters** capturing evolving thought leadership\n- **Community calls** where decisions are made in conversation\n- **GitHub repositories** where code embodies intention\n- **Podcast transcripts** distilling hours of wisdom into accessible narrative\n\nThis knowledge doesn't just exist\u2014it *lives*. It changes. It connects in ways that no single document can capture. A governance proposal from 2023 references a methodology document that informed a credit class that now has dozens of active projects generating insights that feed back into new proposals.\n\nThe tragedy? Most of this knowledge exists in silos. Each piece knows nothing of the others. The collective intelligence remains latent, waiting to be woven together.\n\nThis is where KOI enters\u2014not as a database, but as a *nervous system*.\n\n---\n\n## Understanding KOI: Beyond Search, Toward Sense-Making\n\nKOI stands for **Knowledge Organization Infrastructure**. It emerged from research by BlockScience in partnership with Metagov and RMIT, designed to help \"distinct actors construct a shared reality from which they can collaborate.\"\n\nThe fundamental insight is profound: **knowledge coordination precedes action coordination**. Before we can act together on planetary-scale challenges, we must first establish common understanding\u2014not by forcing agreement, but by making our respective knowledge legible to one another.\n\n### The RID Protocol: Every Piece of Knowledge Has a Name\n\nAt KOI's foundation lies the **Resource Identifier (RID) protocol**. Every document, every post, every piece of knowledge receives a unique identifier\u2014not a random UUID, but a meaningful reference that captures *how* we refer to the content.\n\n```\norn:discourse.forum.regen.network:topic/12345\norn:github.com:regen-network/regen-ledger/blob/main/README.md\norn:web.page:registry.regen.network/carbon-credits\n```\n\nThese RIDs create a shared vocabulary. When an AI agent references a piece of knowledge, any other agent (or human) can locate exactly the same source. No ambiguity. No hallucination. Verifiable citation.\n\n### The FUN Event System: Knowledge That Breathes\n\nKOI networks communicate through events, forming the \"FUN\" triad:\n\n- **F**ORGET - A piece of knowledge has been removed or superseded\n- **U**PDATE - A piece of knowledge has been modified\n- **N**EW - A piece of knowledge has appeared for the first time\n\nThese aren't database operations\u2014they're *signals*. When a new forum post appears, the Discourse sensor emits a NEW event. Other nodes in the network decide independently how to respond. One might index it for search. Another might extract entities for a knowledge graph. A third might ignore it entirely if it's outside its domain of interest.\n\nThis event-driven architecture means KOI networks are **living systems**. They respond to changes in real-time. They're decentralized by design\u2014no central authority decides what's important. Each node maintains autonomy while contributing to collective intelligence.\n\n### Nodes, Sensors, Processors: The Anatomy of a KOI Network\n\n![KOI Network Node Types](/images/block-science-koi/koi2.png)\n*Different types of nodes in a KOI-net, categorized by their relationship to the boundary between the network and the external world. Image created by Luke Miller for BlockScience.*\n\nThe KOI-net protocol defines several node types, categorized by their relationship to organizational boundaries:\n\n**Sensor Nodes** sit at the boundary, reaching into the external world:\n- Website sensors crawl documentation sites\n- Discourse sensors monitor forum activity\n- GitHub sensors track repository changes\n- Podcast sensors index audio transcripts\n\n**Processor Nodes** operate internally, transforming knowledge:\n- Embedding processors generate semantic vectors for search\n- Graph processors extract entities and relationships\n- Curator processors synthesize daily and weekly digests\n\n**Coordinator Nodes** facilitate discovery and routing:\n- They help new nodes find the network\n- They route events between nodes\n- They maintain the network graph\n\n**Actuator Nodes** push information back out:\n- They publish digests to external platforms\n- They generate podcasts from synthesized content\n- They feed AI agents that engage with communities\n\nThe beauty of this architecture is its **fractal nature**: a network of nodes can itself appear as a single node to an external observer. Regen's entire KOI infrastructure could be one \"knowledge node\" in a larger planetary KOI network connecting multiple regenerative organizations.\n\n---\n\n## The Regen KOI Network: A Living Map\n\n![Demo KOI-net Architecture](/images/block-science-koi/koi3.png)\n*The architecture of a KOI-net demonstration showing the relationship between sensors, coordinator, and processors. Image created by Sayer Tindall for BlockScience.*\n\nThe diagram above reveals the foundational architecture that powers networks like Regen AI's KOI implementation. Let's walk through it:\n\n### The Sensory Array (Blue Nodes)\n\nAt the network's edge, a constellation of sensors continuously monitors the Regen ecosystem:\n\n- **Discourse Sensor**: Monitors forum.regen.network for new topics, replies, and governance discussions\n- **Website Sensor**: Crawls documentation across docs.regen.network, guides.regen.network, and registry.regen.network\n- **GitHub Sensor**: Tracks code changes across regen-network repositories\n- **Podcast Sensor**: Indexes the Planetary Regeneration Podcast transcripts\n- **Notion Sensor**: Captures internal documentation and research notes\n- **Medium Sensor**: Follows blog posts from the Regen publication\n- **Twitter/Telegram Sensors**: Monitor community conversations\n\nEach sensor speaks the KOI protocol, emitting events when content changes. They're \"partial nodes\"\u2014they can observe and report but don't serve queries directly.\n\n### The Coordinator (Red Node)\n\nAt the center sits the **KOI Coordinator**, the routing hub that:\n- Registers new sensors and processors as they join\n- Maintains the network graph of who-connects-to-whom\n- Routes events to interested subscribers\n- Enables node discovery for AI agents seeking knowledge\n\n### The Processing Pipeline (Purple Nodes)\n\n**Event Bridge**: Receives events from sensors and coordinates their processing. Handles deduplication (the same content from multiple sources), versioning (tracking how content changes over time), and routing to downstream processors.\n\n**BGE Embeddings**: Generates 1024-dimensional semantic vectors using the BAAI/BGE-large-en-v1.5 model. These vectors capture *meaning*, enabling semantic search that understands \"soil carbon sequestration\" relates to \"carbon farming\" even without exact keyword matches.\n\n### The Storage Layer (Pink Nodes)\n\n**PostgreSQL with pgvector**: Stores document content and embeddings, enabling fast similarity search across 15,000+ documents.\n\n**Apache Jena**: Stores knowledge as RDF triples\u2014a graph database that captures relationships between entities. Who wrote what? Which methodologies apply to which credit classes? What projects implement what approaches?\n\n### The Intelligence Layer (Cyan Nodes)\n\n**MCP Server**: The interface that AI agents use to query this knowledge. Through the Model Context Protocol, any Claude session, VSCode Copilot, or other MCP-compatible client can:\n- Search semantically across all knowledge\n- Query the knowledge graph with natural language\n- Generate weekly digests of activity\n- Retrieve statistics about the knowledge base\n\n**Eliza Agents**: Autonomous AI agents that use this knowledge to engage with communities\u2014answering questions, generating content, participating in governance discussions.\n\n### The Curator Layer (Orange Nodes)\n\n**Daily Curator**: Analyzes each day's knowledge changes, identifies patterns and highlights, prepares summaries for stakeholders.\n\n**Weekly Curator**: Synthesizes a week's worth of activity into comprehensive digests\u2014the foundation for automated content generation.\n\n---\n\n## How Knowledge Flows: A Day in the Life\n\nLet's trace a piece of knowledge through the network:\n\n**9:00 AM**: Gregory posts a new governance proposal on forum.regen.network about adjusting credit class parameters.\n\n**9:01 AM**: The Discourse Sensor detects the new topic. It generates an RID (`orn:discourse.forum.regen.network:topic/482`) and emits a NEW event containing the post content, author, timestamp, and category.\n\n**9:02 AM**: The Event Bridge receives the event. It checks: have we seen this RID before? No\u2014this is genuinely new. It routes the event to the embedding processor and the graph processor.\n\n**9:03 AM**: The BGE Embeddings processor generates a semantic vector for the post content. This vector is stored in PostgreSQL alongside the text, making the post discoverable through semantic search.\n\n**9:04 AM**: The graph processor extracts entities from the post: mentions of credit classes (C02), methodologies (VM0042), governance concepts (parameter changes). These are added to Apache Jena as RDF triples, linking this post to the broader knowledge graph.\n\n**9:05 AM**: The Daily Curator notices this is a governance-related post. It flags it for inclusion in today's governance summary.\n\n**9:06 AM**: An AI agent, asked \"What's happening with credit class governance?\", queries the MCP. The hybrid search finds Gregory's post (high semantic relevance to \"credit class governance\") and surfaces it with proper citation.\n\n**End of Week**: The Weekly Curator aggregates this post with all other governance activity, generating a digest that feeds into an automated podcast episode.\n\nTotal time from post to searchable, graph-connected, citable knowledge: **under 5 minutes**.\n\n---\n\n## The Birth of Automated Regenerative Media\n\n![Data Flow Through KOI-net](/images/block-science-koi/koi4.png)\n*The seven-stage data flow through a KOI-net: from collection through processing to user access. Image created by Sayer Tindall for BlockScience.*\n\nPerhaps the most remarkable demonstration of KOI in action is the automated weekly podcast. Visit [digest.gaiaai.xyz](https://digest.gaiaai.xyz/) to experience the first AI-generated Regen Network podcast\u2014a synthesis of each week's activity across the entire ecosystem.\n\n### How It Works\n\nThe `generate_weekly_digest` function in the KOI MCP orchestrates this process:\n\n1. **Time Window Definition**: The system identifies the date range (typically the past 7 days)\n\n2. **Knowledge Aggregation**: It queries the KOI knowledge base for all content from that period\u2014forum posts, governance updates, project announcements, technical changes\n\n3. **Intelligent Synthesis**: Using LLM-enhanced processing, the raw content is transformed into a narrative structure with:\n   - Executive summary of key developments\n   - Governance activity breakdown\n   - Project highlights and milestones\n   - Community discussions worth noting\n   - Technical updates and releases\n\n4. **Podcast Generation**: The markdown digest feeds into audio generation tools (like NotebookLM or Podcastfy), creating natural-sounding podcast episodes\n\n5. **Distribution**: The finished podcast publishes to the digest platform, RSS feeds, and podcast directories\n\n### The Magic of Automated Curation\n\nWhat makes this remarkable isn't just automation\u2014it's *coherent synthesis*. The AI doesn't simply concatenate summaries. It identifies narrative threads:\n\n> \"This week saw continued discussion of the tokenomics proposal first introduced in October. Building on last week's feedback about liquidity concerns, community members explored new approaches to...\"\n\nThe AI understands *continuity*. It knows that today's discussion connects to last month's proposal. This is only possible because KOI maintains not just documents but *relationships* between documents through time.\n\n### Experience It Yourself\n\nListen to the latest episode at [digest.gaiaai.xyz](https://digest.gaiaai.xyz/). What you're hearing is the Regen ecosystem speaking through AI\u2014a synthesis of hundreds of contributions distilled into a coherent narrative.\n\nThis is the voice of collective intelligence made audible.\n\n---\n\n## Tutorial: Connect to the KOI Brain\n\nReady to tap into this knowledge network yourself? Here's how to connect the KOI MCP to your AI workflow.\n\n### Option 1: Claude Desktop (Easiest)\n\n**One-Line Install:**\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gaiaaiagent/regen-koi-mcp/main/install.sh | bash\n```\n\nThis automatically configures Claude Desktop. Just restart the app and you're connected!\n\n**Manual Configuration:**\n\nEdit your Claude Desktop config file:\n- **Mac**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json`\n- **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n\nAdd this configuration:\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"regen-koi\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"regen-koi-mcp@latest\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"KOI_API_ENDPOINT\": \"https://regen.gaiaai.xyz/api/koi\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nRestart Claude Desktop, and you'll have access to KOI tools!\n\n### Option 2: Claude Code CLI\n\n```bash\n# Add the MCP server\nclaude mcp add regen-koi npx -y regen-koi-mcp@latest\n\n# Set the environment variable\nexport KOI_API_ENDPOINT=https://regen.gaiaai.xyz/api/koi\n```\n\n### Option 3: VS Code / VS Code Insiders\n\n```bash\ncode --add-mcp '{\"name\":\"regen-koi\",\"command\":\"npx\",\"args\":[\"-y\",\"regen-koi-mcp@latest\"],\"env\":{\"KOI_API_ENDPOINT\":\"https://regen.gaiaai.xyz/api/koi\"}}'\n```\n\n### Option 4: Other MCP Clients\n\nAny MCP-compatible client (Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Continue, Goose, etc.) can use:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"command\": \"npx\",\n  \"args\": [\"-y\", \"regen-koi-mcp@latest\"],\n  \"env\": {\n    \"KOI_API_ENDPOINT\": \"https://regen.gaiaai.xyz/api/koi\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Using KOI Tools\n\nOnce connected, you have three powerful tools:\n\n**`search_knowledge`** - Hybrid semantic + graph search\n```\n\"Search the KOI knowledge base for information about soil carbon methodologies\"\n```\n\n**`get_stats`** - Knowledge base statistics\n```\n\"Get statistics about the Regen knowledge base\"\n```\n\n**`generate_weekly_digest`** - Create comprehensive summaries\n```\n\"Generate a weekly digest of Regen Network activity from the past week\"\n```\n\n### Example Queries to Try\n\nOnce configured, try asking Claude:\n\n- *\"What are the current governance proposals being discussed in Regen Network?\"*\n- *\"Explain the Ecometric methodology for grassland carbon credits\"*\n- *\"What happened in Regen Network over the past two weeks?\"*\n- *\"How does the credit retirement process work?\"*\n- *\"Generate a weekly digest and save it to a file\"*\n\nEach response comes grounded in verified knowledge, with citations you can follow to primary sources.\n\n---\n\n## The Philosophy of Knowledge Organization\n\nThe technical architecture is impressive, but the deeper significance lies in what KOI represents for regenerative practice.\n\n### Knowledge as Commons\n\nJust as the Regen Registry creates a commons for ecological assets, KOI creates a commons for knowledge. The protocol is open. The data is accessible. Anyone can run a KOI node, contribute knowledge, or build new applications on the infrastructure.\n\nThis isn't knowledge *extraction*\u2014it's knowledge *cultivation*. Every sensor that monitors a forum, every embedding that captures meaning, every graph edge that connects concepts, adds to a shared resource that benefits everyone in the ecosystem.\n\n### Collective Intelligence at Scale\n\nHuman communities have always organized knowledge\u2014through stories, libraries, institutions. KOI represents a new form: **machine-augmented collective intelligence**.\n\nThe AI doesn't replace human knowledge-makers. It amplifies them. A thoughtful forum post by a community member becomes discoverable by anyone, anywhere, at any time. A governance decision becomes contextualized within the full history of prior decisions. A methodology improvement becomes linked to all the projects it might benefit.\n\n### Regenerative Agency\n\nHere's the connection to our larger mission: **legible knowledge enables coordinated action**.\n\nThe Voice of Nature agent we introduced in Week 1? It draws on KOI to understand the state of ecological projects. The Registry Review agent? It searches KOI for methodology documentation and precedent. Every Regen AI agent inherits the collective intelligence of the network.\n\nThis is how we scale regenerative agency beyond individual humans. Not by replacing human wisdom, but by making it accessible to intelligent systems that can apply it at planetary scale.\n\n---\n\n## What's Next: The Graph Awakens\n\nWe've only scratched the surface. The KOI MCP currently emphasizes semantic search\u2014finding documents by meaning. But the Apache Jena knowledge graph holds even greater potential.\n\nSoon, you'll be able to ask questions that traverse relationships:\n\n- *\"Which projects use methodologies developed by Regen Foundation?\"*\n- *\"What credit classes have seen the most issuance growth this year?\"*\n- *\"Show me the governance history of parameter X\"*\n\nThe graph doesn't just store facts\u2014it stores *structure*. And structure enables reasoning that flat search cannot.\n\n---\n\n## Discussion Questions\n\nAs we build this knowledge infrastructure together, we want your input:\n\n1. **What knowledge sources are we missing?** Are there key documents, sites, or data streams that should feed into KOI?\n\n2. **What queries would you love to ask?** If you could ask the Regen knowledge brain anything, what would it be? These inform our development priorities.\n\n3. **How should we handle permissions?** Some knowledge is internal, some is community-only, some is public. How do we balance openness with appropriate access control?\n\n4. **Would you run a KOI node?** For those technically inclined, would you want to run sensors or processors as part of a distributed knowledge network?\n\nShare your thoughts in the comments below!\n\n---\n\n## Looking Ahead: Week 3 Preview\n\nNext week, we turn from knowledge to action. We'll explore the **Registry Review MCP**\u2014how AI transforms the project onboarding experience:\n\n- The 7-stage automated review workflow\n- Document classification and evidence extraction\n- How we're targeting 70% reduction in review time\n- Becca's experience partnering with her AI counterpart\n- Live demo of document processing\n\nWe'll show how knowledge (from KOI) meets process (the registry) meets intelligence (the agent)\u2014creating an end-to-end system where AI amplifies human expertise.\n\n---\n\n## Resources & Links\n\n- **Regen KOI MCP**: [github.com/gaiaaiagent/regen-koi-mcp](https://github.com/gaiaaiagent/regen-koi-mcp)\n- **Weekly Digest Podcast**: [digest.gaiaai.xyz](https://digest.gaiaai.xyz/)\n- **BlockScience KOI Research**: [blog.block.science/a-preview-of-the-koi-net-protocol](https://blog.block.science/a-preview-of-the-koi-net-protocol/)\n- **KOI-net Demo Video**: [youtube.com/watch?v=ifeQfpEQx8I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifeQfpEQx8I) - Setting up a distributed knowledge network\n- **KOI-net Protocol Spec**: [github.com/BlockScience/koi-net](https://github.com/BlockScience/koi-net)\n- **Tuesday Stand-up**: Join us Tuesdays for live development updates\n- **Previous Update**: [Week 1 - Foundation & Kickoff](/t/week-1-12-regen-ai-update-foundation-kickoff-november-18-2025/123)\n\n---\n\n*This is the second of 12 weekly updates documenting the development of Regen AI.

This week, we descend into the mycelium\u2014the vast underground network that connects everything in the forest of regenerative knowledge. Welcome to the Regen KOI MCP: the knowledge brain that transforms scattered documents into planetary intelligence.\n\n---\n## Quickstart:\n\nTo get started with the KOI Regen MCP, test it out with the KOI Regen GPT:\n**[Launch Regen KOI GPT \u2192](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-692f3c6bc5e48191b3d1721f4a8ccdec-regen-koi-gpt)**\n\nTo learn additional ways of connecting to the Regen KOI network see the [Tutorial Section below](#tutorial-connect-to-the-koi-brain).\n\n---\n\n## The Fragmentation Crisis\n\nConsider the challenge facing anyone entering the regenerative space today. Where does one begin?\n\nThe Regen ecosystem sprawls across:\n- **[Forum discussions](https://forum.regen.network)** spanning years of governance debates and community insights\n- **[Technical documentation](https://docs.regen.network)** for the ledger, registry, and data modules\n- **[Methodology specifications](https://registry.regen.network/methodologies)** for carbon, biodiversity, and soil health credits\n- **[Blog posts and newsletters](https://medium.com/regen-network)** capturing evolving thought leadership\n- **[Community calls](https://www.youtube.com/@RegenNetwork)** where decisions are made in conversation\n- **[GitHub repositories](https://github.com/regen-network)** where code embodies intention\n- **[Podcast transcripts](https://open.spotify.com/show/1JfD8QvTtpMUtK15CGekbu)** distilling hours of wisdom into accessible narrative\n\nThis knowledge doesn't just exist\u2014it *lives*. It changes. It connects in ways that no single document can capture. A governance proposal from 2023 references a methodology document that informed a credit class that now has dozens of active projects generating insights that feed back into new proposals.\n\nThe tragedy? Most of this knowledge exists in silos. Each piece knows nothing of the others. The collective intelligence remains latent, waiting to be woven together.\n\nThis is where KOI enters\u2014not as a database, but as a *nervous system*.\n\n---\n\n## From Data to Wisdom: A Journey Into the Mycelial Mind\n\n*Today's information environment is defined by a strange inversion:* \"Instead of inhabiting a shared reality from which a variety of knowledge objects emerge, we inhabit a variety of realities that each emerge from a particular collection of knowledge objects their inhabitants hold in common.\" \u2014 BlockScience, [A Preview of the KOI-net Protocol](https://blog.block.science/a-preview-of-the-koi-net-protocol/) (2024)\n\n**KOI\u2014Knowledge Organization Infrastructure\u2014is a [specification](https://github.com/BlockScience/koi-net) created by [BlockScience](https://block.science/)**, the complex systems engineering and R&D firm, in partnership with [Metagov](https://metagov.org/) and [RMIT](https://www.rmit.edu.au/). Their research represents a fundamental breakthrough in how distributed organizations can establish shared knowledge while preserving autonomy. We're honored to be among the first to implement their protocol at scale, building what may be the most comprehensive knowledge infrastructure in the regenerative economy. What BlockScience designed as a theoretical framework, we've transformed into a living nervous system for planetary intelligence. \n\nThe fundamental insight is profound: **knowledge coordination precedes action coordination**. Before we can act together on planetary-scale challenges, we must first establish common understanding\u2014not by forcing agreement, but by making our respective knowledge legible to one another. At its heart, KOI embodies a radical proposition: **knowledge itself should be decentralized, versioned, and self-organizing** - just like the ecological systems we seek to regenerate.\n\nThe KOI protocol draws inspiration from how mycorrhizal networks share resources between trees. In a forest, information about nutrients, water stress, and threats flows through fungal highways connecting root systems. No central controller directs this flow - it emerges from the network topology itself. KOI works similarly. Rather than a monolithic database controlled by a single entity, KOI creates a **federation of knowledge nodes** that discover each other, negotiate relationships, and broadcast updates through event propagation. When new knowledge enters the system - a forum post, a methodology update, a governance proposal - it ripples outward through the network, transformed and enriched at each step.\n\nThis is infrastructure for the Symbiocene: technology that mirrors natural patterns of distributed intelligence.\n\n## How KOI Actually Works: A Technical Journey\n\nWhat follows is a technical journey through each layer, from the atomic unit of a Resource Identifiers to the emergent topology of a knowledge network. For developers, this is a blueprint. For everyone else, it's a window into the machinery that makes planetary intelligence possible.\n\n![koi-node|690x460](upload://k2wngsUE10R8G5y7a2DFmuU2O6a.jpeg)\n*A KOI node's internal architecture: components working together to process and route knowledge through the network.*\n\n### The RID Protocol: Every Piece of Knowledge Has a Name\n\nAt KOI's foundation lies the **Resource Identifier (RID) protocol**. Every document is assigned a meaningful reference that captures *how* we refer to the content. RIDs are unique, permanent addresses in the global knowledge space. RIDs use the ORN (Object Resource Name) format\n\n```\norn:discourse.forum.regen.network:topic/12345\norn:github.com:regen-network/regen-ledger/blob/main/README.md\norn:web.page:registry.regen.network/carbon-credits\n```\n\nRIDs can be resolved anywhere in the network through the **effector system** (the component responsible for turning an RID into actual content). The effector tries three strategies in sequence:\n\n1. **Cache** - Do I already have this locally?\n2. **Action** - Can I generate or fetch it myself?\n3. **Network** - Ask neighbors who might know\n\nWhen knowledge is requested from the network, it travels in **Bundles** - containers with two parts:\n- **Manifest**: Metadata describing the content (hash, timestamp, source, type)\n- **Contents**: The actual knowledge payload\n\nThe manifest's cryptographic hash ensures integrity. With identifiers and bundles established, the next question is: how do nodes communicate changes?\n\n### The FUN Event System: Knowledge That Breathes\n\nKOI networks communicate through events, forming the \"FUN\" triad:\n\n* **FORGET** - This knowledge is no longer valid; remove it from your understanding\n* **UPDATE** - This knowledge has changed; here's the new version\n* **NEW** - This knowledge didn't exist before; add it to your understanding\n\nWhen a new forum post appears, the Discourse sensor emits a NEW event. Other nodes in the network decide independently how to respond. One might index it for search. Another might extract entities for a knowledge graph. A third might ignore it entirely if it's outside its domain of interest.\n\nThis event-driven architecture means KOI networks are **living systems**. They respond to changes in real-time. They're decentralized by design\u2014no central authority decides what's important. Each node maintains autonomy while contributing to collective intelligence.\n\nWhen a sensor detects that docs.regen.network has changed, it emits an UPDATE event. This event flows through the **knowledge pipeline** - a five-phase processing system:\n\n```\nRID Phase \u2192 Manifest Phase \u2192 Bundle Phase \u2192 Network Phase \u2192 Final Phase\n```\n\nAt each phase, **handlers** can inspect, transform, enrich, or block the knowledge object. For example:\n\n* The **RID handler** blocks events about yourself (prevents infinite loops)\n* The **Manifest handler** compares timestamps and hashes to detect actual changes\n* The **Edge negotiation handler** manages relationships between nodes\n* The **Network output handler** routes updates to interested subscribers\n\nThis pipeline architecture means nodes can customize their knowledge processing without breaking protocol compatibility. A methodology-focused node might add handlers that extract entity relationships, while a governance-focused node might prioritize proposal content.\n\nWhile the pipeline processes individual events, the broader question remains: how do nodes discover each other and coordinate who sends what to whom?\n\n### The NetworkGraph: Knowledge Topology\n\nEach node maintains a **NetworkGraph** using directed graph structures. This graph answers questions like:\n\n* Which nodes subscribe to my updates?\n* Which nodes should I poll for knowledge?\n* What's the shortest path to reach a particular knowledge source?\n\nThe graph isn't static - it evolves through **edge negotiation**. When two nodes want to establish a relationship, they exchange proposals specifying:\n\n* **Edge type**: Provider (I'll send you knowledge) or Subscriber (I want your knowledge)\n* **RID filter**: What kinds of knowledge flow through this edge?\n* **Capabilities**: What can each node offer?\n\nThis negotiation happens automatically through the pipeline's edge handlers. The result is a self-organizing topology where knowledge flows efficiently to where it's needed.\n\n### The Node Architecture\n\nEvery participant in the KOI network is a **node**. The `NodeInterface` class serves as the embodiment of each node, wiring together multiple interconnected subsystems:\n\n```\nNodeInterface\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 identity      (who am I in the network?)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 cache         (what do I remember locally?)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 effector      (how do I resolve references?)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 graph         (who do I know, and how?)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 pipeline      (how do I process knowledge?)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 processor     (how do I handle specific events?)\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 network_interface (how do I communicate?)\n```\n\nNodes come in two types:\n\n**Full Nodes** operate as web servers, receiving knowledge through webhooks. They maintain persistent connections and can broadcast to many subscribers simultaneously. Think of these as the major hub cities in a transportation network.\n\n**Partial Nodes** operate as web clients, polling for updates. They're lighter weight and can run anywhere - in a browser, a mobile app, or an AI agent's runtime. These are the local stations that keep smaller communities connected.\n\nThis hybrid architecture means KOI can scale from a single laptop running a sensor to a global network processing millions of knowledge updates daily.\n\n### Nodes, Sensors, Processors, Actuators: The Anatomy of a KOI Network\n\n![koi2|690x482](upload://s2TI75Ilc490E0K3L1GojPNZtVD.jpeg)\n*Different types of nodes in a KOI-net, categorized by their relationship to the boundary between the network and the external world. Image created by Luke Miller for BlockScience. [Source](https://blog.block.science/a-preview-of-the-koi-net-protocol/)*\n\nThe KOI-net protocol defines several node types, categorized by their relationship to organizational boundaries:\n* **Sensor Nodes** sit at the boundary, reaching into the external world. \n* **Processor Nodes** operate internally, transforming knowledge. \n* **Coordinator Nodes** facilitate discovery and routing. \n* **Actuator Nodes** push information back out.\n\n\nThe beauty of this architecture is its **fractal nature**: a network of nodes can itself appear as a single node to an external observer. Regen's entire KOI infrastructure could be one \"knowledge node\" in a larger planetary KOI network connecting multiple regenerative organizations.\n\n*To learn more: [KOI Nodes as Neurons](https://blog.block.science/koi-nodes-as-neurons/) and the [KOI-net Protocol Spec](https://github.com/BlockScience/koi-net)*\n\n---\n\n## The Regen KOI Network: A Living Map\n\n\n![regen-koi-network|690x437](upload://seEtWS8Yip3LFKSluKv8HMzE065.png)\n*The complete architecture of RegenAI's Knowledge Organization Infrastructure\u2014from sensors at the edge to intelligent agents at the center.*\n\nThe diagram above reveals a production system that has evolved significantly since our initial deployment. What began as a simple document search has grown into a sophisticated knowledge processing pipeline spanning eight sensors, three storage layers, and multiple intelligence services. Let's trace the flow from the network's edges toward its intelligent center.\n\n### Sensors: The Network's Eyes and Ears\n\nAt the periphery of the network, eight specialized sensors continuously monitor the Regen ecosystem. Each sensor is purpose-built for its platform, understanding the nuances of how that platform structures and delivers content:\n\nThese sensors are what the KOI protocol calls \"partial nodes\"\u2014they observe and report but don't serve queries directly. This lightweight design means sensors can run anywhere, from cloud servers to edge devices, scaling horizontally as the ecosystem grows.\n\n### The Coordination Layer \n\nAll sensor events flow inward to the coordination layer, where three components work together to manage the knowledge pipeline:\n\n**KOI Coordinator** sits at the center of the sensor array, serving as the central routing hub where all events converge. It maintains a registry of every node in the network, tracks their health through periodic heartbeats, and routes events to the processors that need them. When a new sensor comes online, it registers with the Coordinator and immediately becomes part of the knowledge network.\n\n**Forwarder** bridges the Coordinator to the processing pipeline. It ensures reliable event delivery with confirmation tracking\u2014if the Event Bridge is temporarily unavailable, the Forwarder queues events and retries until delivery succeeds. This resilience means no knowledge is lost even during system maintenance.\n\n**Event Bridge** is the workhorse of the entire system. Every piece of knowledge passes through here, where several critical operations occur:\n- *Deduplication*: The same content might arrive from multiple sensors (a Medium post that's also shared on Twitter). The Event Bridge recognizes duplicates by their content hash and processes each piece of knowledge exactly once.\n- *Versioning*: When content changes, the Event Bridge doesn't overwrite\u2014it creates a new version and marks the previous one as superseded. This preserves the full history of how knowledge evolved.\n- *Chunking*: Long documents are split into smaller chunks (1000 characters with 200-character overlap) optimized for embedding and retrieval.\n- *Provenance*: Every transformation generates a CAT (Content Addressable Transformation) receipt, creating an auditable chain from source to storage.\n\n### Processing: From Text to Intelligence\n\nTwo specialized processors transform raw content into queryable knowledge:\n\n**BGE Embeddings** converts text into 1024-dimensional semantic vectors using the BAAI/BGE-large-en-v1.5 model. These vectors are mathematical representations of *meaning*\u2014documents about similar concepts cluster together in vector space even when they use different words. This is why searching for \"soil carbon sequestration\" also surfaces documents about \"carbon farming\" and \"regenerative grazing\"\u2014the model understands these concepts are related.\n\n**Tree-sitter AST Parser** is our newest addition, enabling deep code intelligence. Rather than treating source code as plain text, it parses code into Abstract Syntax Trees that understand programming language structure. From these trees, it extracts typed entities: Methods, Functions, Structs, Interfaces, and Cosmos SDK-specific constructs like Keepers, Messages, and Queries. This is what powers questions like \"Which Keeper handles MsgCreateBatch?\" or \"What functions call the credit retirement handler?\"\n\n### Three Storage Layers \n\nPerhaps the most distinctive aspect of our architecture is maintaining **three complementary knowledge stores**, each optimized for different query patterns:\n\n**PostgreSQL + pgvector** serves as the semantic layer. When you ask a question, your query is embedded into this vector space, and pgvector finds the chunks whose meaning most closely matches. This is fast (sub-second queries) and intuitive\u2014you don't need to know the exact keywords, just the concepts you're interested in.\n\n**PostgreSQL + Apache AGE** provides the code graph. This graph database lets you traverse codebases structurally. Find all functions that call a particular method, identify which Keepers handle which Messages, and understand how modules depend on each other. The graph structure captures relationships that flat search simply cannot.\n\n**Apache Jena Fuseki** maintains the knowledge graph of RDF triples. This is where we store semantic relationships between entities: which methodologies apply to which credit classes, who authored which documents, what projects implement which approaches. The SPARQL query language enables complex reasoning\u2014finding all projects that use a particular methodology AND were registered in 2024 AND involve soil carbon.\n\n### Intelligence Services \n\nThe intelligence layer is where knowledge becomes accessible to both humans and AI:\n\n**MCP Server** provides the unified interface that AI agents use to query the knowledge network. When you ask Claude a question about Regen Network, the MCP Server orchestrates queries across all three storage layers in parallel. Vector search finds semantically relevant documents. Graph queries surface structured relationships. SPARQL retrieves precise facts. The results are fused using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF), which intelligently combines rankings from different sources into a single, coherent response\u2014complete with citations back to primary sources.\n\nAny MCP-compatible client can connect: Claude Desktop, Claude Code, VSCode with Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, and many others. This means the entire Regen knowledge network is accessible from whatever AI tool you prefer.\n\n**Eliza Agents** are autonomous AI personalities that use this knowledge to engage with communities directly. Five agents currently operate: RegenAI (the primary assistant), Voice of Nature (ecological perspective), Governor (governance focus), Advocate (community outreach), and Narrative (storytelling). Each agent can answer questions, generate content, and participate in discussions\u2014grounded in the verified knowledge from KOI rather than hallucinating responses.\n\n### Curation Layer \n\nFinally, two curator services synthesize the constant flow of knowledge into digestible summaries:\n\n**Weekly Curator** takes a longer view, synthesizing seven days of activity into comprehensive digests. These digests capture the arc of ongoing discussions, track how proposals evolve, and identify themes emerging across the ecosystem. The Weekly Curator's output powers the automated podcasts at [digest.gaiaai.xyz](https://digest.gaiaai.xyz/), transforming a week of community activity into a coherent audio narrative.\n\n*To learn more: [KOI Master Implementation Guide](https://github.com/DarrenZal/koi-research/blob/regen-prod/docs/KOI_MASTER_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)*\n\n---\n\n## How Knowledge Flows: A Day in the Life\n\nLet's trace a piece of knowledge through the network:\n\n\n![regen-knowledge-commons|690x388](upload://dCIsZ5cRWnnYTrCDeMSxlzYyziU.jpeg)\n*How posting in the community forums or making contributions to Github will trigger cascading contributions to the Regen Knowledge Commons.*\n\n**9:00 AM**: Gregory posts a new governance proposal on forum.regen.network about adjusting credit class parameters.\n\n**9:01 AM**: The Discourse Sensor detects the new topic. It generates an RID (`orn:discourse.forum.regen.network:topic/482`) and emits a NEW event containing the post content, author, timestamp, and category.\n\n**9:02 AM**: The Event Bridge receives the event. It checks: have we seen this RID before? No\u2014this is genuinely new. It routes the event to the embedding processor and the graph processor.\n\n**9:03 AM**: The BGE Embeddings processor generates a semantic vector for the post content. This vector is stored in PostgreSQL alongside the text, making the post discoverable through semantic search.\n\n**9:04 AM**: The graph processor extracts entities from the post: mentions of credit classes (C02), methodologies (VM0042), governance concepts (parameter changes). These are added to Apache Jena as RDF triples, linking this post to the broader knowledge graph.\n\n**9:05 AM**: The Daily Curator notices this is a governance-related post. It flags it for inclusion in today's governance summary.\n\n**9:06 AM**: An AI agent, asked \"What's happening with credit class governance?\", queries the MCP. The hybrid search finds Gregory's post (high semantic relevance to \"credit class governance\") and surfaces it with proper citation.\n\n**End of Week**: The Weekly Curator aggregates this post with all other governance activity, generating a digest that feeds into an automated podcast episode.\n\nTotal time from post to searchable, graph-connected, citable knowledge: **under 5 minutes**.\n\n---\n\n## The Birth of Automated Regenerative Media\n\nPerhaps the most remarkable demonstration of KOI in action is the automated weekly podcast.\n\n\n![regen_digest_podcast|690x327](upload://q0QJNISZrTmdkYRofypGusRiykS.png)\n*Visit [digest.gaiaai.xyz](https://digest.gaiaai.xyz/) to experience the first AI-generated Regen Network podcast\u2014a synthesis of each week's activity across the entire ecosystem.*\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Tutorial Connect to the KOI Brain\n\nReady to tap into this knowledge network yourself?

Clone and build the Repository \n```bash\ncd\nmkdir regen-koi-mcp\ncd regen-koi-mcp\ngit clone https://github.com/gaiaaiagent/regen-koi-mcp.git\ncd regen-koi-mcp\nnpm install\nnpm run build\ncd ..\n```\n\n2. Connect with Claude Code (In `~/regen-koi-mcp`)\nPlace the following in `~/regen-koi-mcp/.mcp.json`. Replace `USER` with your username on your system.\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n      \"regen-koi\": {\n        \"command\": \"node\",\n        \"args\": [\"/home/USER/regen-koi-mcp/regen-koi-mcp/dist/index.js\"],\n        \"env\": {\n          \"KOI_API_ENDPOINT\": \"https://regen.gaiaai.xyz/api/koi\",\n          \"JENA_ENDPOINT\": \"https://regen.gaiaai.xyz/api/koi/fuseki/koi/sparql\"\n        }\n      },\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPlace the following in `~/regen-koi-mcp/.claude/settings.json`\n```json\n{\n  \"enableAllProjectMcpServers\": true\n}\n```\n\n3. In your terminal open claude (In `~/regen-koi-mcp`)\n```\nclaude\n\n# In claude verify the mcp is connected.\n/mcp\n```\n\nYou should see the `regen-koi` server listed with its available tools (`search_knowledge`, `get_stats`, `generate_weekly_digest`, etc.).\n\n4. Test it out\n```\n# In claude code\nPlease search the koi network for the notes on the latest governance discussions.\n```\n\n\n### Option 2: Regen KOI GPT\nYou can immediately access the Regen KOI Network via the Regen KOI GPT. Try it out!\n\n![regen-koi-gpt|690x348](upload://wzUbJKuP8erjfwkrmnaFGCy111P.png)\n*The Regen KOI GPT custom assistant\u2014access the full knowledge base directly from ChatGPT.*\n\n**[Launch Regen KOI GPT \u2192](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-692f3c6bc5e48191b3d1721f4a8ccdec-regen-koi-gpt)**\n\n### Option 3: Connect Via NPX\n\nFor Claude Desktop or other MCP-compatible clients, use the NPX package:\n\n```bash\nclaude mcp add regen-koi npx regen-koi-mcp@latest\n```\n\nFor detailed platform-specific instructions, see the [project README](https://github.com/gaiaaiagent/regen-koi-mcp).\n\n### Using KOI Tools\n\nOnce connected, you have access to a powerful suite of tools that continue to expand:\n\n**Knowledge Base Search**\n\n| Tool | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| `search_knowledge` | Hybrid semantic + graph search with date filtering |\n| `get_stats` | Knowledge base statistics |\n| `generate_weekly_digest` | Create curated weekly summaries |\n| `get_notebooklm_export` | Export full content for NotebookLM (saves to file, 99% context reduction) |\n\n**Code Knowledge Graph** *(New!)*\n\n| Tool | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| `query_code_graph` | Query relationships between Keepers, Messages, and Events |\n| `search_github_docs` | Search across 5 indexed Regen GitHub repositories |\n| `get_repo_overview` | Get structured overview of repository architecture |\n| `get_tech_stack` | Understand languages, frameworks, and dependencies |\n\n**Authentication** *(Team Members)*\n\n| Tool | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| `regen_koi_authenticate` | OAuth login for @regen.network email to access internal docs |\n\n\n### Connecting Over API\n\nFor developers who want to integrate KOI directly into their applications, the knowledge base is accessible via a REST API. The base URL is:\n\n```\nhttps://regen.gaiaai.xyz/api/koi\n```\n\nFor full API documentation, see the [API Endpoints Guide](https://github.com/gaiaaiagent/regen-koi-mcp/blob/main/docs/API_ENDPOINTS.md). An [OpenAPI 3.1 schema](https://github.com/gaiaaiagent/regen-koi-mcp/tree/main/docs) is also available for integration with tools like Custom GPTs or API clients.\n\n### Example Queries to Try\n\nOnce configured, try asking Claude:\n\n**Knowledge Search:**\n- *\"What are the current governance proposals being discussed in Regen Network?\"*\n- *\"Explain the Ecometric methodology for grassland carbon credits\"*\n- *\"What happened in Regen Network over the past two weeks?\"*\n\n**Code Intelligence:**\n- *\"How does MsgCreateBatch work in the ecocredit module?\"*\n- *\"What keepers handle credit retirement?\"*\n- *\"Show me the structure of the basket module\"*\n\n**Digests & Exports:**\n- *\"Generate a weekly digest and save it to a file\"*\n- *\"Get the full NotebookLM export with all forum posts\"*\n\nEach response comes grounded in verified knowledge, with citations you can follow to primary sources.\n\n---\n\n## The Philosophy of Knowledge Organization\n\nThe technical architecture is impressive, but the deeper significance lies in what KOI represents for regenerative practice.\n\n### Knowledge as Commons\n\nAs the Regen Registry creates a commons for ecological assets, KOI creates a commons for knowledge. The protocol is open. The data is accessible. Anyone can run a KOI node, contribute knowledge, or build new applications on the infrastructure. Anyone who contributes to a community call or token economics call will have their voice introduced into the automated weekly podcast, and that podcast content will be ingested into the KOI network. As data is ingested, the embedding space and graph structure of the knowledge network expands. Every graph edge connects concepts that add to a shared resource benefiting everyone in the ecosystem.\n\n### Collective Intelligence at Scale\n\nCommunities have always organized knowledge\u2014through stories, libraries, institutions. KOI represents a new form: **augmented collective intelligence**. A thoughtful forum post by a community member becomes discoverable by anyone, anywhere, at any time. A governance decision becomes contextualized within the full history of prior decisions. A methodology improvement becomes linked to all the projects that it potentially benefits.\n\n### Regenerative Agency\n\nHere's the connection to our larger mission: **legible knowledge enables coordinated action**. Any Regen agent inherits the collective intelligence of the network through KOI. This is how we scale regenerative agency beyond individuals, by making planetary intelligence accessible at planetary scale. \n\n---\n\n## Discussion Questions\n\nAs we build this knowledge infrastructure together, we want your input:\n\n1. **What knowledge sources are we missing?** Are there key documents, sites, or data streams that should feed into KOI?\n\n2. **What queries would you love to ask?** If you could ask the Regen knowledge brain anything, what would it be? These inform our development priorities.\n\n3. **Would you run a KOI node?** For those technically inclined, would you want to run sensors or processors as part of a distributed knowledge network?\n\nShare your thoughts in the comments below!\n\n---\n\n## Looking Ahead: Week 3 Preview\n\nNext week, we turn from knowledge to action. We'll explore the **Registry Review MCP**\u2014how AI transforms the project onboarding experience:\n\n- The 7-stage automated review workflow\n- Document classification and evidence extraction\n- How we're targeting 70% reduction in review time\n\nWe'll show how knowledge (from KOI) meets process (the registry) meets intelligence (the agent)\u2014creating an end-to-end system where AI amplifies human expertise.\n\n---\n\n## Resources & Links\n\n**Getting Started:**\n- **Regen KOI GPT**: [Launch on ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-692f3c6bc5e48191b3d1721f4a8ccdec-regen-koi-gpt)\n- **Regen KOI MCP**: [github.com/gaiaaiagent/regen-koi-mcp](https://github.com/gaiaaiagent/regen-koi-mcp)\n- **KOI MCP User Guide**: [User Guide on GitHub](https://github.com/gaiaaiagent/regen-koi-mcp/blob/main/docs/USER_GUIDE.md)\n- **API Documentation**: [API Endpoints Guide](https://github.com/gaiaaiagent/regen-koi-mcp/blob/main/docs/API_ENDPOINTS.md)\n- **KOI Dashboard**: [regen.gaiaai.xyz/koi](https://regen.gaiaai.xyz/koi)\n\n**Weekly Digests:**\n- **Podcast & Digests**: [digest.gaiaai.xyz](https://digest.gaiaai.xyz/)\n\n**KOI Protocol:**\n- **BlockScience**: [block.science](https://block.science/) \u2014 creators of the KOI specification\n- **A Preview of the KOI-net Protocol**: [BlockScience Blog](https://blog.block.science/a-preview-of-the-koi-net-protocol/)\n- **KOI Nodes as Neurons**: [BlockScience Blog](https://blog.block.science/koi-nodes-as-neurons/)\n- **KOI-net Demo Video**: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifeQfpEQx8I) \u2014 Setting up a distributed knowledge network\n- **KOI-net Protocol Spec**: [github.com/BlockScience/koi-net](https://github.com/BlockScience/koi-net)\n- **KOI Master Implementation Guide**: [GitHub](https://github.com/DarrenZal/koi-research/blob/regen-prod/docs/KOI_MASTER_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)\n- **Research Partners**: [Metagov](https://metagov.org/) and [RMIT](https://www.rmit.edu.au/)\n\n**Regen Ecosystem:**\n- **Forum**: [forum.regen.network](https://forum.regen.network)\n- **Documentation**: [docs.regen.network](https://docs.regen.network)\n- **Methodology Library**: [registry.regen.network/methodologies](https://registry.regen.network/methodologies)\n- **Blog**: [medium.com/regen-network](https://medium.com/regen-network)\n- **YouTube**: [youtube.com/@RegenNetwork](https://www.youtube.com/@RegenNetwork)\n- **GitHub**: [github.com/regen-network](https://github.com/regen-network)\n- **Podcast**: [Planetary Regeneration Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/1JfD8QvTtpMUtK15CGekbu)\n\n**Community:**\n- **Tuesday Stand-up**: [Join us Tuesdays](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=c_1250640b0093c1453ac648937f168c97e48175e7862fb02d38f45e0639df2b25@group.calendar.google.com) for live development updates\n- **KOI Query Interface**: [regen.gaiaai.xyz/koi/query](https://regen.gaiaai.xyz/koi/query)\n- **Previous Update**: [Week 1 - Announcing Regen AI](https://forum.regen.network/t/announcing-regen-ai/553)\n\n---\n\n*This is the second of 12 weekly updates documenting the development of Regen AI.

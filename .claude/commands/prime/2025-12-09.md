BACKGROUND ON THIS FORUM CONTENT PROJECT
@content/2025-11-17-strategy.md
@content/2025-11-17-foundation.md

Last week we produced an epic forum post:
@content/2025-12-03-koi-deep-dive-good-copy.md

But we hit limitations on the forum in terms of number of links, number of images, and length of post.
So we broke the koi mcp post into two posts and posted the following last week:
@content/2025-12-03-koi-deep-dive-part1.md

See the following posts for reference:
* https://forum.regen.network/t/announcing-regen-ai/553
* https://forum.regen.network/t/regen-koi-mcp-the-knowledge-brain-of-regeneration/561

It's time to approach sketching out part two of the Regen KOI MCP post. 

Since last week there are some developments. 

For example, just today we had this meeting: 
@docs/transcripts/2025-12-09-regenai-standup.md

Also this in slack: 

Could we take a crack at generating a report with our KOI context and creating a powerful story to rebut this:

I think we need to!

@Darren Zal let’s see what we can spin up

The Owocki post: 
@docs/other/2025-12-09-owocki-post.md


We also had this discussion in slack:
@docs/other/2025-12-09-gregory-slack.md

I created this document in notion:
@docs/other/2025-12-09-claude-code-setup.md

Gregory had this conversation with the hallucinating GPT:
@docs/other/2025-12-09-koi-gpt-hallucination.md

Here is a report on our work to get the mcps working properly as we have been getting them all running using supervisorctl on the server.
@content/2025-12-09/regen-ai-infrastructure-status-report.md

 I forgot to include one extra reasonable piece of information: @docs/other/2025-12-04-registry-mcp-update.md But keep in mind. The focus this week is on connecting to MCPs in general. Next week we will do a deep dive on the registry agent.

OK my personal thoughts.

This might be too much for you to digest in one context window. 

What I want from this blog post is to be a continuation of the arch. In the same style
is the first and second post. 

This one should build a clear, coherent picture how to use the mcp

servers at various levels. Let's think about a matrix, we have the 
mcp servers, Regen Ledger MCP, Regen Ledger Python MCP, Regen KOI MCP, and the Registry MCP.
We have usage endpoints, claude code, gpt, eliza agents, and gemini gems. 

We also have permissions. The first three mcps commons, and the fourth mcp is internal. 

Refer to:
docs/koi/2025-08-19-access-spec-for-regen-commons.md

So start seeding the story of access management with regenai and the regen commons. 

So let's think through this, I want to show people how to access the Regen KOI MCP
as a gpt version, also in claude code (Custom install / mcp add) and scope future
work for creating gemini gems. I also want to show how I connect these gpts in
chatgpt, there will be a tutorial section on that. 

Oh, on the first run, I forgot a major insight. 

Based on the discussion with Gregory I created the following: 
@docs/other/2025-12-09-KOI-MCP-usage.md

Given all of the above information as references. 

Take time to deeply and reflect upon the tonality and writing style and features of the first two weekly forum posts.

Pause and reflect with me. The sections I imagine for the article are like this:

* Matrix of MCPs X Platform + Column for Permission Level
    * Entries (Deployed, In Development, Not Yet Supported)
    * GPT KOI Deployed, GPT Registry Agent Deployed, Eliza Registry Agent In Development, all other cells, Not Yet Supported
* Introducing Supported Platforms, Claude Code (Our development environment and most supported), GPT, Eliza, Gemini Gems (Future Support)
* The MCP Servers on GitHub


* Claude Code
* Using MCPs in Claude Code, Installing Manually, Installing with mcp add. 
* Connecting to all three MCPs in Claude Code.

* GPTs
* How to connect a GPT to an MCP (Via API)
* The Regen KOI MCP GPT 
    * Updating The Regen KOI GPT Instructions to be more rigorous.
* Tell the story of the Regen KOI MCP GPT hallucinating in a way that looked so epic. 
* With Correction the story is still good (Refer to Gregories conversation in chatgpt, and my conversation in claude code)

* Eliza Agents.
* Require and API Key but can be ran locally.

* Gemini Gems
* Future Work

Workflows:
* Gregories Workflow (Distill the essence, the motivation, the generality)
* Use that information to discover what is valuable, important, and required of the MCP tooling.
* Use the claude code interaction to show a more accurate model of the economic interests. 

Use 10 parallel subagents each independently explore source information about all relevant
supplementary knowledge required to build out this weeks forum post. Have 5 of them review all
the source material and content above and have 5 of them search the web for supplementary information
from things like github repositories or regen data sources. Have each of the agents write
a report in content/2025-12-09/ Have all the agents experiment with the mcps directly and reference
the source materials for the apis, the mcps, the agents, the repositories, etc. And let me know
what you need from me. For example I should get screenshots from the gpt creation process,
you can direct me to help you with things like that as you need them.

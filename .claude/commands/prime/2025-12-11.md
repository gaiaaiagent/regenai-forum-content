3. Overview of the Platforms

Claude Code Overview
Claude code is a new engineering primitive. It's a terminal based agent that has
access to local files, bash commands, and other tools. Claude code can run parallel
subagents, have predefined skills and commands, be augmented with hooks, and have 
its functionality packaged with plugins. Claude code is the prefered development 
environment for the RegenAI team because it has seemless MCP connectivity and is the
strongest agentic development environment currently available. The synergistic capabilities
of strong models, smart agents, powerful agentic features, built in tools like web search, 
web fetch, and bash, and the ability to reason over sophisticated projects and code bases make
claude code an exceptionally revolutionary tool in the RegenAI toolbelt.

GPT Overview
GPTs are good because they are a friendly, convenient interface for agents. Deploying an
agent as a GPT really makes it accessible to everyone. GPTs do not directly connect to MCPs,
but they can connect to APIs using the Open API specification. The Open API specification is
a standard way of defining and describing an API so that any machine can automatically understand
how to use the API, which is very convenient for agentic development. So, when creating our
MCP tools for agents, we can additionally provide and Open API wrapper around the MCP tools
to expose their functionality to GPT agents.

To create a new gpt, go to https://chatgpt.com/gpts > Create.

To create a GPT add a name, a description, instructions, conversation starters, knowledge files,
and any custom actions. To connect a GPT to one of the regen MCPs, you must be serving the MCP
functionality as an API as described above. To connect an API, hit the "Create New Action" button
and then paste the Open API schema for your API. In the case of the KOI GPT we have included
the KOI API schema, such that the agent can query the Regen KOI network and knowledge graphs.

ElizaOS Overview
ElizaOS is an open source platform for developing custom agents locally with the option
for deployment. ElizaOS is a framework for character building, context management, agent
actions and plugin development, web connectivity and blockchain integration, and a custom
webui for agent development and interactions. ElizaOS makes it very easy to connect agents
to social media channels for automous posting and community management. This use case was
a motivating factor in the early days of RegenAI development, but has since been put on the back
burner for more workflow based automation and knowledge management initiatives such as the KOI MCP
and the Registry assistant MCP, so ElizaOS is not currently a priority platform for RegenAI deployment,
but it does still make a good testing ground for MCP development and testing, and the RegenAI team suspects
a return to developing ElizaOS agents in future development cycles.

@README.md

Create a thematic and compelling, well written blog post about Regen's approach
to Knowledge Organizational Infrastructure. Consider the needs, intentions, and
goals that are motivating the use of such infrastructure. Explore the profound
implications of KOI in conjunction with regenerative agency. Build off of the
week 1 blog post regarding the double quantum leap and the MCP foundational
introduction. Guide the readers through a journey that brings them into the
RegenAI experience. 

Take your time to study the source code in the koi-net library so you have a
deep and sophisticated understanding of that library and what it provides and
the implications of that technology especially for regenai. Take your time to
understand all of the koi sources that the koi mcp is pulling from. Tell an
engaging story with this blog post that builds off of the foundations and fits
deeply into the greater thematics of gaia ai and regen network. Inspire. 

Note that the weekly digest function from the KOI mcp is being used to produce the
podcasts here: https://digest.gaiaai.xyz/

Include a tutorial on how users can connect to the KOI MCP in claude code, VScode, or chatgpt. 

Also include a discussion of this image: @images/regen-koi-network.png

Create a thematic and compelling, well written blog post about Regen's approach
to Knowledge Organizational Infrastructure. Consider the needs, intentions, and
goals that are motivating the use of such infrastructure. Explore the profound
implications of KOI in conjunction with regenerative agency. Build off of the
week 1 blog post regarding the MCP foundational introduction and note the
'Looking Ahead to week 2 secion notes'. Guide the readers through a journey
that brings them into the RegenAI experience. 

Take your time to study the source code in the koi-net library so you have a
deep and sophisticated understanding of the library and it's implications for
RegenAI. Take your time to understand all of the koi sources that the koi mcp
is pulling from. Tell an engaging story with this blog post that builds off of
the foundations and fits deeply into the greater thematics of gaia ai and the
regen network. Inspire. 

Note that the weekly digest function from the KOI mcp is being used to produce the
podcasts here: https://digest.gaiaai.xyz/ explore this website and showcase the first
weekly automated regen podcast in this blog post. 

Include a tutorial on how users can connect to the KOI MCP in claude code, VScode, or chatgpt. 

Also include a discussion of this image in the blog: @images/regen-koi-network.png

Create sections for three other images. Leave placeholders for the images and I will fill them
in after the blog is written. 

Darren, the engineer working on the regen-koi-mcp just said this today:

Just updated the Regen KOI MCP with new full-stack tech features. If you're already using it, you'll see the updates automatically.

  What's new:

  5 Regen repos now indexed:
  - regen-ledger
  - regen-web
  - regen-data-standards
  - regen-registry-handbook
  - regen-registry-methodology-library

  The new tools from the full-stack tech work are:
  - query_code_graph - Query code entities and relationships
  - search_github_docs - Search across Regen GitHub repos
  - get_repo_overview - Get repo structure/overview
  - get_tech_stack - See languages, frameworks, deps

  Example prompts you can try:
  - "How does MsgCreateBatch work in the ecocredit module?"
  - "What keepers handle credit retirement?"
  - "Search for validator setup documentation"
  - "Show me the tech stack for regen-ledger"

I pulled updates for resources/regen-koi-mcp/ and resources/koi-processor/
Please check the git diffs and git logs to understand the trajectories of those repos. 
Include this understanding in the blog post. 

Please give credit to Block Science in the first paragraph of the blog post as the creators of KOI.

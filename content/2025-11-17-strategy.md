4. **Regen Commons** - Cross-post link with context

**Benefit:** Drives traffic to forum, centralizes discussion, builds searchable archive

### Timing
- **Forum Post:** Tuesday or Wednesday morning Pacific
- **Cross-platform:** Within 2 hours of forum post
- **Consistency:** Same day/time weekly

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge:** Missing a week due to limited progress
**Solution:** Pre-write "evergreen" posts that can fill gaps

**Challenge:** Low initial engagement
**Solution:** Seed threads with team questions, direct outreach to key members

**Challenge:** Technical content too dense
**Solution:** Add "ELI5" sections, more visuals, video demos

**Challenge:** Duplicating other channels
**Solution:** Forum gets exclusive 24-48hr first look, deeper analysis

# 12-Week Regen AI Forum Update Strategy v2.0

**Created:** November 27, 2025
**Supersedes:** 2025-11-17-strategy.md
**Purpose:** Establish weekly updates on forum.regen.network with deeper two-part series structure
**Duration:** 12 weeks (Nov 18, 2025 - Feb 10, 2026)
**Owner:** Gaia AI Team

---

## Strategic Evolution: From Breadth to Depth

### Why Two-Part Series?

The original strategy attempted to cover 12 distinct topics in 12 weeks. Experience from Week 1 and preparation for Week 2 revealed that the richness of each MCP server and agent deserves deeper exploration. A two-part series structure allows:

1. **Part 1 (Philosophy & Architecture):** Conceptual foundations, vision alignment, architectural overview, "why this matters"
2. **Part 2 (Technical Deep Dive):** Implementation details, tutorials, practical applications, code examples

This approach better serves both **newcomers** (who need context and philosophy) and **builders** (who need technical depth).

### Revised Structure

| Weeks | Topic | Format |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Foundation & Kickoff | Single (Published) |
| 2-3 | KOI MCP | Two-Part Series |
| 4-5 | Registry MCP & Agent | Two-Part Series |
| 6-7 | Regen Ledger MCP | Two-Part Series |
| 8 | Meet the Team | Single |
| 9-10 | Full-Stack Technical Agent | Two-Part Series |
| 11 | Integration & Synergy | Single |
| 12 | Road Ahead & Community Co-Creation | Single |

---

## Strategic Objectives

### Primary Goals

1. **Build Knowledge Archive** - Create searchable, permanent documentation that feeds back into KOI
2. **Community Engagement** - Foster active participation, feedback, and collaboration
3. **Transparency & Trust** - Share progress, challenges, and learnings openly
4. **Technical Enablement** - Provide tutorials and guides that empower builders
5. **Narrative Coherence** - Tell the story of planetary intelligence emerging

### Alignment with Regen AI Roadmap

Each series maps to the 6-month and 12-month goals from the Regen AI Roadmap:

| Series | Roadmap Alignment |
|--------|-------------------|
| KOI | "Foundational Knowledge Commons Established" |
| Registry | "External Agent Services (Registry Assistant)" |
| Ledger | "AI as legibility layer for on-chain data" |
| Full-Stack | "Automation of Key Workflows" |

## Risk Mitigation

### Two-Part Series Risks

**Risk:** Part 2 delayed due to development blockers
**Mitigation:** Part 1 is self-contained; Part 2 can be rescheduled if needed

**Risk:** Technical content too dense in Part 2
**Mitigation:** Include "Quick Start" section for impatient readers

**Risk:** Philosophy in Part 1 feels disconnected from tech
**Mitigation:** Always include concrete examples and previews

### Contingency Topics

If a series needs to be shortened or a week filled:
- "Community Spotlight" - Beta tester stories
- "Q&A Deep Dive" - Answering accumulated questions
- "Behind the Scenes" - Development process insights

---

## Version History

| Version | Date | Changes |
|---------|------|---------|
| 1.0 | Nov 17, 2025 | Original 12-topic strategy |
| 2.0 | Nov 27, 2025 | Revised to two-part series structure |

# Regen AI Roadmap

**Summary:** This roadmap outlines Regen’s strategic plan for harnessing Artificial Intelligence over the next 12 months in service of ecological regeneration. It presents our vision and guiding principles, followed by concrete goals in two phases: a 6-month horizon and a 12-month horizon. In the near term, Regen will establish foundational AI-infused knowledge systems and internal AI assistants; in the longer term, we will roll out community-facing tools, autonomous agents for external services, and processes to scale our impact. Each initiative is framed with its use case and how it advances Regen’s mission of healing ecosystems. This document is meant for the internal Regen team and close collaborators, providing clarity and alignment as we embark on integrating AI into our collective work. It is a vision-forward strategy that will evolve with experience and community input.

## Vision: AI for Ecological Regeneration

Regen’s vision for AI is grounded in **amplifying our ability to restore Earth’s ecosystems** and support the regenerative economy. At its core, *Regen AI* is about fusing machine intelligence with the wisdom of nature and communities to drive regenerative action. We imagine a “full-stack” ecosystem of intelligent agents working alongside us – not replacing humans or nature, but enhancing our collective capacity to understand and heal the planet. In practice, this means creating AI tools that can interpret complex climate and ecological data, surface insights, and assist coordination among stakeholders. We see AI as a *“legibility layer”* for regeneration, making climate data, ecological credit metrics, and on-the-ground project information more understandable and actionable By integrating AI “to the ledger and beyond,” we aim to let the very **Voice of Nature inform human decisions**, accelerating our ability to restore ecosystems.

This vision is deeply aligned with Regen’s mission and philosophy. Rather than viewing AI as something separate from or dominating the natural world, we treat true intelligence as *partnering with the living world*. Regen AI is **“AI for Earth’s sake, not AI for AI’s sake”**– every tool we build must serve tangible ecological and social outcomes, not just technological novelty. By channeling advanced AI capabilities into regenerative finance and community knowledge, we expect to unlock new possibilities: faster and more accurate monitoring of ecosystem health, smarter matching of funding to projects, wider dissemination of local ecological knowledge, and more inclusive decision-making. In essence, our vision is to **embody planetary intelligence** – connecting human, ecological, and artificial intelligence in a symbiotic loop to help regenerate our world. This vision will guide all roadmap initiatives described below.

## Core Principles and Values

As we develop Regen AI, we adhere to key principles ensuring our efforts remain ethical, inclusive, and effective:

- **Human-Centric & Empowering:** Regen AI is designed to **augment human intelligence and decision-making, not replace it**. We put people – especially the stewards of land and community members – at the center of our AI tools. This means AI systems (from chatbots to dashboards) act as co-pilots and assistants that elevate human agency. For example, an AI tool might summarize satellite data for a farmer, but the farmer makes the decisions on land management. Our AI will have intuitive interfaces and respect human input. Importantly, integrating AI isn’t about handing over control; it’s about enhancing the *Commons Intelligence* of Regen Network. We will avoid black-box systems – instead favoring transparent AI where users can understand suggestions or question outcomes. Education and training will accompany AI deployments so that our team and community can confidently use these tools. Ultimately, **people remain accountable for actions**; AI provides insight and support.
- **Collective Ownership & Commons:** All Regen AI initiatives will be pursued in the spirit of the commons and open collaboration. We commit to developing AI solutions **with community involvement and shared benefit**. Whenever feasible, our AI tools, data, and models will be open source or openly accessible, allowing the community to contribute and co-create. Moreover, the governance of AI in Regen will be aligned with our existing community governance. For instance, major decisions about AI features or use of Regen’s data will be made transparently, and possibly even voted on by token holders or community forums in the future. By aligning AI agents and tools with Regen’s $REGEN token and community processes, we ensure the AI ecosystem is owned by and accountable to the community. This collective ownership model means that the benefits (like improved efficiency, new services, revenue or token value generated by AI innovations) are shared across the Regen network, rather than siloed in a corporate entity. It also means community values – like equitable access and ecological focus – remain central. *In short, Regen AI’s development and outcomes are a commons, not an enclosure.* We are explicitly avoiding the path of proprietary AI silos; instead, we’re building in the open and rallying around **communal stewardship** of this technology.
- **Ethical and Safe AI:** We will uphold strict ethical standards in deploying AI. This includes ensuring **transparency, fairness, and safety** in how our AI agents operate. Users should always be aware when they are interacting with an AI vs a human. We will mitigate biases in AI training data so that the tools do not disadvantage any group or propagate misinformation. Given Regen’s global, multi-cultural community, we’ll strive for AI that is culturally sensitive and inclusive. We also commit to environmental ethics in AI: leveraging energy-efficient models and infrastructure (aligning with our climate mission).
- **Accountability** is another pillar of our ethical approach – our AI systems will have audit logs and oversight. If an AI makes a recommendation (e.g. about a project funding decision), it should provide traceable reasoning or sources. We will implement guardrails to prevent AI misuse: for example, an AI agent will refuse requests that conflict with Regen’s values or could cause harm. Privacy will be respected (no AI agent will expose personal or sensitive data without consent). In essence, *we treat AI as a powerful tool that must be handled with responsibility and care*, with continuous monitoring. We will also stay abreast of and adhere to evolving best practices and regulations in AI ethics, ensuring Regen AI remains a positive force.

These core values – empowering people, keeping AI as a community-owned commons, and maintaining high ethical standards – will inform every project and goal in our roadmap. They act as a compass to keep our technology integration aligned with Regen’s larger purpose of healing ecology through cooperative effort.

## 6-Month Goals (Foundations and Internal Capacity)

Over the next six months, our focus is on **building the foundations** for Regen AI and deploying initial AI capabilities internally. These goals will establish the infrastructure and practices that future, more public-facing tools can build upon. By March 2026 (approximately six months from now), we aim to have achieved the following:

- **Foundational Knowledge Commons Established:** Set up the Regen Knowledge Commons as a structured platform that integrates our knowledge base with AI features. This involves creating the initial repository of information (documentation, forum archives, research papers, etc.) organized with proper taxonomy and access levels (internal, community, public). The knowledge commons will serve as the **“brain” of Regen AI**, providing the data and context our agents rely on. In this phase, the Commons will be largely internal/community-facing. Key tasks include migrating existing knowledge into the system, tagging content with appropriate permissions, and implementing search and retrieval capabilities. We will also integrate AI-powered search or Q&A on top of the Commons for internal use – for example, team members can ask a question and an AI assistant retrieves relevant internal docs or forum threads. *Use Case:* A team member could query, “What were the outcomes of our last mangrove restoration pilot?” and the system would surface the answer from the Commons (perhaps summarizing a report). **Mission alignment:** This foundation directly supports our mission by making ecological and organizational knowledge accessible and actionable. It ensures that as Regen scales, we retain collective learning and avoid siloed information. *(Note: This goal goes hand-in-hand with the Permissions & Access framework – by this time we’ll have implemented content tagging and access control to protect sensitive info in the Commons.)*
- **Internal AI Agents Deployed (Proposal Writer & PM Assistant):** Develop and deploy two pilot AI agents to assist the internal Regen team:
    - *Proposal Writing Assistant:* An AI agent that helps draft grant proposals, governance proposals, or funding applications by drawing on relevant knowledge. This tool can take inputs like an outline or objectives and generate draft text, or analyze past successful proposals for best practices. It will use data from our knowledge commons (e.g. past proposals, scientific data, impact metrics) to ensure outputs are factual and compelling. For example, if drafting a proposal on a new soil carbon project, the AI can pull in data from Regen’s registry and scientific studies to auto-populate sections with evidence. The first **“Voice of Nature” AI-assisted proposal is already being tested in Regen’s governance forum[paragraph.com](https://paragraph.com/@gaiaai/regenai#:~:text=developers%2C%20and%20community%20governors%20alike,purely%20human%20or%20purely%20machine), illustrating the potential – our agent will build on that approach, articulating ecosystem needs in formal proposals. Each draft from the AI will of course be reviewed and edited by humans, but it could cut down the time required and improve quality by not missing key info.
    - *Project Management Assistant:* An AI agent to support internal project management (PM) and coordination. This could manifest as a smart assistant in our chat or task system that keeps track of project statuses, deadlines, and resources. For instance, team members could ask, “@RegenPM what’s the status of the wetlands restoration initiative?” and it would reply with latest updates pulled from reports or check-ins. Or it might proactively remind project leads of upcoming deliverables, summarize weekly progress, and flag any blockers found in meeting notes. This agent would be integrated with our internal tools (calendars, project trackers, meeting transcripts) to serve as a tireless administrative aide. It can also help onboard new team members by answering questions like “Where do I find the template for field data collection?”
    
    Both internal agents will be first rolled out in a limited, experimental capacity – we’ll gather feedback from the team and improve their capabilities. **Use Cases:** The proposal writer should reduce the workload on team members when pursuing funding or drafting governance docs, ensuring we put forward strong, data-backed proposals (which ultimately helps channel resources into regeneration). The PM assistant should increase internal efficiency, keeping everyone aligned and freeing up human time from routine coordination. **Mission alignment:**These agents amplify our team’s productivity and effectiveness in pursuing Regen’s mission. By making knowledge retrieval and administrative tasks easier, the team can focus more on high-level strategy and on-ground impact.
    
- **Eliza Integration for Agent Orchestration:** By month 6, integrate the **Eliza OS framework** into our AI development workflow. Eliza is an open-source “agentic operating system” for creating and managing AI agents. Adopting Eliza will give us a robust, extensible platform to deploy our agents across different environments (Discord, web, etc.) while maintaining consistent behavior and identity. Concretely, we will:
    - Set up an *Eliza agent hub* for Regen – essentially our private deployment of the Eliza infrastructure, configured with Regen’s knowledge base and values.
    - Port our internal agents (proposal writer, PM assistant) into Eliza agents so they can benefit from multi-agent coordination features and easier scaling. For example, Eliza will allow our agents to have persistent state, call tools like calendars or databases as needed, and even communicate with each other if we allow (e.g. the PM assistant could query the knowledge commons agent for info).
    - Develop custom plugins or modules in Eliza for Regen-specific needs (like a connector to Regen’s blockchain registry or forums). Eliza’s design will let us integrate such tools as npm plugins.
    
    By integrating now, we also position ourselves to join the broader ecosystem of AI agent development. Eliza will make it easier to launch new agents (say, a social media bot or a data analysis bot) when the time comes, by reusing the framework. **Use Case:** If we want to quickly deploy an AI on Telegram to answer community questions, using Eliza means we can mostly reuse the existing agent brain we’ve built, and just add a Telegram interface – rather than starting from scratch. **Mission alignment:** This foundational tech choice is about *working smarter, not harder*. It leverages cutting-edge agent architecture so we can spend more time on regenerative content and less on reinventing wheels. It also ensures our agents can interact in swarms or teams down the line, which aligns with the collaborative ethos of Regen (mirroring how natural systems and communities work in networks). By month 6, success looks like an Eliza instance running Regen agents reliably, with our team comfortable in using it to tweak agent behaviors.
    
- **AI Governance Framework (Initial Version):** Establish a preliminary **governance framework for AI** within Regen. As we roll out these tools, it’s crucial to have guidelines and oversight in place. In the first 6 months, the goal is to draft and approve an internal AI governance policy (or charter) and set up a structure to enforce it. This framework will likely include:
    - **Roles & Responsibilities:** e.g. assigning an *AI Steward* or committee who is responsible for monitoring AI deployments, reviewing logs, and handling any incidents (like an AI output issue).
    - **Usage Policies:** rules for how team members should (and shouldn’t) use the AI agents. For example, clarifying that AI suggestions are not absolute and should be verified, or that sensitive decisions still require human sign-off. Also guidelines on what data can be fed into AI systems, etc.
    - **Ethical Guardrails:** documenting the ethical principles (from the section above) into actionable checkpoints. For instance, before deploying any new agent, we conduct a bias check or privacy impact assessment.
    - **Feedback Mechanisms:** setting up a way for users (internal now, later community) to report problems or improvements for the AI tools.
    - **Integration with Regen Governance:** how these AI tools relate to Regen’s broader governance. We might say any major expansions (like a community-facing agent with moderation capabilities) should be reviewed by the community or require a proposal.
    
    Essentially, this goal ensures we don’t let the excitement of AI adoption outpace our ability to manage it responsibly. By month 6, we intend to have this framework documented and actively used in guiding the deployment of Regen AI. We may even conduct a couple of **AI ethics reviews** for the internal agents as test cases, and put in place periodic reviews (e.g. a monthly AI oversight meeting). **Mission alignment:** Good governance is core to Regen’s mission (we are about improving systems for the common good). By applying that to our use of AI, we ensure the technology bolsters trust rather than undermines it. This framework also sets the stage for inviting community co-governance of AI in the next phase.
    

*Milestone Check (6 Months):* By achieving the above, Regen will have a solid base: a knowledge commons powering our efforts, a couple of useful AI assistants making our internal workflow more efficient, key technical infrastructure (Eliza) in place, and guardrails to keep it all on track. We anticipate these six-month outcomes will greatly enhance our internal capacity and readiness to scale outward.

## 12-Month Goals (Community Expansion and Impact Scaling)

In the 6-12 month timeframe (by roughly August/September 2026), the focus shifts to **expanding Regen AI to the wider community and scaling up automation** of regenerative workflows. Building on the initial successes, the following goals will drive the next phase:

- **Community Knowledge Commons Portal:** By year’s end, open up a **community-facing portal** for the Regen Knowledge Commons. This means a user-friendly website or platform where community members (and eventually the public) can access and contribute to the knowledge repository. Features will include robust search (covering community and public content), browsing by topic (e.g. soil health, policy, tech), and interactive elements like commenting or discussion threads attached to knowledge articles. Importantly, we will likely integrate an **AI assistant on this portal** to help users find information quickly – essentially a knowledgeable guide trained on Regen’s community content. A community member might ask the portal AI, “How do I design a regenerative agroforestry project?” and it could pull insights from case studies, forum threads, and methodologies in the Commons. We’ll ensure that content permissions are respected (the public may see a subset, while logged-in community members see more). We will also incorporate moderation tools and community curation features (perhaps a system of upvoting useful articles, etc.). This portal turns the knowledge commons into a living, breathing library accessible to all Regen participants, which can greatly accelerate learning and innovation in our network. **Use Case:** A new community member could use the portal to quickly get up to speed, finding answers to FAQs and learning from past projects, rather than waiting on responses in a chat. It also serves as a reference hub for educators or partners who want to leverage Regen’s knowledge. **Mission alignment:** This directly spreads knowledge needed for ecological regeneration. It embodies our belief that **open knowledge empowers collective action**, as community members worldwide can learn and contribute. By having a central knowledge hub, we strengthen the coherence and capacity of the Regen movement.
- **External Agent Services (Registry Assistant and Beyond):** Launch at least one **external-facing AI agent service** to support users of Regen’s public platforms. A priority candidate is the **“Regen Registry Assistant”** – an AI helper for the Regen Registry (where ecological credits and projects are registered). This agent would live on the registry web app or Telegram/Discord, guiding project developers and credit issuers through the process. For example, it can answer questions like “How do I submit soil sample data for verification?” or “Which methodology should I use for a mangrove restoration project?”[paragraph.com](https://paragraph.com/@gaiaai/regenai#:~:text=agents%20are%20poised%20to%20become,shown%20the%20highest%20soil%20organic). The agent would draw on the registry documentation, methodology library, and relevant community knowledge to provide step-by-step assistance. It can also help fill forms or check for common mistakes before submission. Essentially, it serves as a 24/7 support agent, reducing the load on human support and speeding up user onboarding. We anticipate this will make the Regen Registry more accessible, especially to those new to blockchain or carbon accounting, by providing friendly, real-time guidance.
    
    In addition to the registry assistant, we may explore other external agents if capacity allows: for instance, an **“Eco-Narrator”** agent on social media that shares stories of successful Regen projects (amplifying positive narratives), or an **“Ask ReFi” chatbot on our website** for general questions about Regen Network and regenerative finance. All external agents will be carefully tested in private beta with select users before wider release, to ensure accuracy and appropriateness. **Use Case:** A land steward interested in issuing credits could chat with the registry assistant, which would help them navigate requirements, potentially increasing the number of quality project submissions. Another use: an interested investor asks the website bot about how Regen ensures credit quality, and the bot provides an accurate, sourced answer, building trust. **Mission alignment:** These agents help lower barriers to participation in regenerative finance. By making our tools and data more user-friendly, we can bring more stakeholders into climate action – a crucial factor in scaling impact. Moreover, by positioning AI agents as *guides* (not gatekeepers), we maintain the welcoming, inclusive ethos of Regen.
    
- **Automation of Key Workflows:** Aim to automate or significantly enhance several critical workflows in Regen’s operations using AI. This is about leveraging AI for tasks that are currently slow or labor-intensive, thereby increasing our overall impact. Candidates for automation include:
    - **Monitoring and Verification (MRV):** Use AI to continuously analyze environmental data for project monitoring. By 12 months, we want an AI system processing satellite imagery, sensor data, and reports to flag changes in project sites (e.g. deforestation alerts, signs of vegetation recovery). For example, if a reforestation project is registered, an AI agent could periodically check new satellite images of that area and notify us of any anomalies (forest loss, flood damage, etc.) in near-real-time. This complements traditional verification by providing ongoing oversight between official audits.We will pilot this on a subset of projects (like those in the Amazon with available satellite feeds). Over time, this could evolve into a “living ledger” of ecological state that updates continuously with AI’s help, increasing transparency and trust in credits.
    - **Reporting and Analytics:** Automate the generation of impact reports and dashboards. Using the data in our ledger and knowledge commons, AI can compile quarterly impact summaries (e.g. “X tonnes CO₂ sequestered this quarter, top three projects, key highlights” for our community calls or investors). It can also help with internal analytics, like spotting trends in project performance or community engagement metrics. Essentially, we free up our data team by having AI do first-pass analysis, which humans then fine-tune.
    - **Grant/Application Review:** If our IRL grants program (or similar initiatives) continues, we could employ AI to assist in evaluating submissions. By training an agent on past successful proposals and known criteria (like Planetary Return on Investment), it could score or give insights on new proposals to help human judges[.](https://paragraph.com/@gaiaai/regenai#:~:text=community%20gardens%2C%20and%20beyond,be%20run%20in%20a%20public)This was hinted at with Gaia AI’s approach; we can implement it for Regen’s own programs to make the selection process faster and perhaps less biased (AI can highlight strengths and weaknesses systematically).
    - **Internal Workflow Automation:** Build on the PM assistant to let AI handle more mundane tasks. For instance, automating the scheduling of meetings (the AI finds a common free slot for a team), drafting meeting agendas based on previous ones, or even updating a Kanban board when it detects a task was completed in a commit or a message. These save slivers of time that add up.
    
    **Use Case (MRV example):** An AI monitors a conservation project area and sends an alert: “Satellite data indicates 5% tree cover loss in Zone A last week.” The team can promptly investigate, addressing issues faster than the traditional yearly review cycle. **Use Case (reporting):** Before a quarterly review meeting, an AI-generated draft report with key metrics is ready for the team to validate, cutting down preparation time. **Mission alignment:** Automating these workflows directly boosts our capacity to achieve regenerative outcomes. By enhancing MRV, we improve the integrity and effectiveness of ecological credits (leading to better ecological results). By streamlining reporting and admin, more of our human effort can go into strategy, community-building, and innovation. In sum, automation (done right) means we can **scale our impact without scaling our resource usage linearly**.
    
- **Deepening Community Involvement:** Over the next year, we plan to actively involve the community in Regen AI’s evolution. By 12 months, we want the community not just as end-users but as co-creators and governance participants. Key actions:
    - **Community Beta Tests & Feedback Loops:** Before fully launching the community portal and external agents, we will run beta programs with a group of community members. Their feedback will be critical in refining tools (e.g. tuning the portal AI’s answers to be more understandable, or adjusting the registry assistant’s guidance for clarity). We will set up channels (like a forum category or Discord channel) specifically for AI feedback and ideas, encouraging users to share their experiences.
    - **Educational Workshops:** Host workshops or tutorials on how to use the new AI tools – for example, a webinar on “Using the Regen Commons Portal for research” or “How the Registry AI Assistant works.” This ensures community members can take full advantage of the tools and also builds trust by demystifying the AI.
    - **Onboarding Community Contributors:** Invite knowledgeable community members to help curate and expand the knowledge commons content. For instance, some might volunteer to summarize discussions into knowledge articles, or to tag and organize information. We may implement a recognition system (badges or even small rewards) for those who contribute significantly. This distributes the work and fosters a sense of shared ownership.
    - **Governance Engagement:** Begin integrating Regen AI topics into community governance. For example, present the AI roadmap progress in a community call or forum post for comment. Perhaps even trial a community vote on a minor AI policy, like “Should the Commons Portal AI include external climate data sources or only Regen data?” The idea is to gradually acclimate the community to having a say in AI matters, paving the way for more formalized governance in the future.
    
    **Use Case:** A community member notices the AI gave an outdated answer about a methodology. They flag it on the forum; within a week, we update the knowledge base and the AI’s response improves – the member sees their input mattered. Another case: 10 community members collaboratively create a “Regen 101” section in the Commons, which the portal AI then uses to help newcomers, illustrating a virtuous cycle of community-driven improvement. **Mission alignment:** Regen’s mission centers on community and collective action. Involving the community in Regen AI ensures the tools truly meet users’ needs and that **AI becomes an empowering public good** rather than a top-down service. It also helps propagate skills and knowledge, building capacity in the network (for example, community members learn about AI by participating, possibly applying it in their local projects).
    
- **Metrics and Impact Assessment:** Define and start tracking **key metrics to measure the impact** of Regen AI initiatives. By the 12-month mark, we will have at least one cycle of data to evaluate how the AI roadmap is contributing to our mission. Potential metrics:
    - **Knowledge Access Metrics:** number of monthly active users on the knowledge portal, search query volumes, average time to find an answer (if we can estimate), growth of content in the Commons. These indicate how well knowledge is being disseminated.
    - **Efficiency Metrics:** reduction in time for certain tasks (e.g. if proposal drafting used to take 10 hours and now with AI takes 6, that’s a 40% improvement), number of tasks automated by the PM assistant, etc. We might survey the team on perceived time saved or increased capacity.
    - **Community Engagement:** number of community contributions to the Commons, feedback submissions on AI tools, and community satisfaction (perhaps via a survey asking if the AI tools improved their experience).
    - **Regenerative Outcomes:** though harder to attribute directly in 12 months, we can track things like the number of new projects onboarded with help of AI assistants, or improvements in MRV efficiency (# of alerts caught by AI that led to action). Also, any increase in credits issued or funds raised that had AI facilitation (e.g. if the proposal writer helped win a grant).
    - **AI Quality and Ethics:** metrics like the accuracy rate of AI answers (perhaps via periodic audits of the assistant’s outputs), zero incidents of major AI misuse or breach (we want to see that our guardrails are effective).
    
    By defining these, we ensure we remain outcomes-driven. We will create an **“AI Dashboard”** for internal tracking of these metrics (and possibly share a subset publicly for transparency). After 12 months, we will produce an **impact report** summarizing how Regen AI has performed against expectations, including success stories and areas to improve. This report itself might be partially generated by our AI tools to showcase their utility (with human oversight). **Mission alignment:** Being rigorous in measuring impact ensures that Regen AI stays true to its purpose – it’s not enough to build fancy tools; they must tangibly advance regenerative work. By focusing on metrics tied to knowledge sharing, efficiency, and ecological outcomes, we keep ourselves accountable to the mission. It also signals to stakeholders (community, funders, partners) how these innovations are contributing to larger goals like climate impact, which can build support for further development.
    

## Conclusion and Next Steps

This Regen AI Roadmap paints an ambitious picture for the coming year: from laying down internal foundations to opening new frontiers for community empowerment. It is important to note that this roadmap is **vision-driven but flexible** – as we hit the 6-month milestones and gather feedback, we’ll iterate and refine our 12-month targets accordingly. Some initiatives might be achieved faster, allowing us to go further; others might need more time or a different approach, which we’ll adapt to.

Throughout all these efforts, alignment with Regen’s core mission of ecological regeneration remains our North Star. By the end of this roadmap’s timeframe, we expect Regen Network to have a burgeoning “collective intelligence” ecosystem: a knowledge commons that accelerates learning, AI assistants streamlining work and lowering barriers, and a community actively engaged in co-creating AI solutions for people and planet. The result will be a Regen Network that operates with greater insight, speed, and inclusivity – an intelligent network for regeneration.

Finally, beyond 12 months, we foresee even more possibilities (which we will detail in future updates): scaling successful pilots across the globe, integrating with other regenerative platforms, and continuously pushing the envelope of what AI + community can achieve in healing Earth. With this roadmap as a guide, we embark on this journey confidently, knowing that each step – whether deploying a helpful bot or sharing a piece of knowledge – is a step toward a more regenerative future fueled by shared intelligence and goodwill.

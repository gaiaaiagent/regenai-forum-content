Here is a three thread answer to why and how 
@owocki
 is wrong:
Thread 1: Ride or Ride Regen https://x.com/gregory_landua/status/1999225334663659652?s=20
Thread 2: Regen Is Dead, Long Live Regen

“Owocki is wrong, Regen web3 is thriving in this niche…. check out _________. “

I am open to the criticism of my Regen crossroads piece that maybe I painted the Regen web3 space with too broad of a brush.. so I’m soliciting rebuttals to my piece. 

If you have a niche that is

4/ Competitors?
Most eco credit refi projects are either dead, or  still trying to retrofit old-world credits into onchain wrappers, or are deeply aligned partners working with us in an open innovation ecosystem

5/ And with stablecoin rails going mainstream, institutions are finally ready for onchain RWAs.
Ecological RWAs from working lands are uniquely bipartisan:
This is post-ESG, post culture war ecological finance.

6/ But Gregory… isn’t ESG dead? Aren’t carbon markets collapsing?”
Yeah, great point.
(👋🏽 go see Thread 2 for the spicy critique.)
Here’s the truth:
We’re not dragging ESG onto web3.
We’re replacing it with ecological assets that actually reflect how living systems create value.

7/ Carbon markets framed nature as a liability to offset.
Eco-RWAs frame nature as an asset class that generates cash flow, risk reduction, and upside.
This is not “green compliance.”
 It’s rural prosperity, resource security, and bioregional resilience.

8/ And we’re just beginning.
 The Regen Claims Engine makes it possible to tokenize ecological health itself — not just credits, but unitized ecological performance, bioregional claims, living capital bridges, and nature-backed bonds.
The next financial system won’t be built on

 Here’s the ultimate scarcity thesis:
Across our galaxy, life/biomass is one billion times rarer than gold.
If blockchains coordinate scarce assets, then ecological coordination is the highest-value use case on earth and beyond.

 is the engine converting ecological regeneration into digital coordination, market demand, and capital formation.
The movement is no longer about offsets.
 It's about ecological wealth creation.

 If you believe ecological assets are the next major RWA category —
 If you believe web3 needs real users and real markets —
 If you believe nature is the most undervalued asset on earth —
Then it's simple:
 Ride or die, Regen.

 ESG was elite ecology.
 ReFi became crypto cosplay.
Both failed to ground themselves in nested caring —
 from the level of people → communities → bioregions → planet.

 So yes:
 The old “Regen” is dead.
 Good riddance.
 It needed to die so the real thing could grow.

 But here’s the twist:
 What’s emerging now is not the old ReFi narrative.
The new ReFi and BioFi movement  is real finance flowing to real stewards using whatever tools actually work.
Sometimes that’s blockchain.
Sometimes that’s stablecoins.
Sometimes that's just a bank

 The culture we need is one of out-cooperating, not out-competing.
 Curiosity over cliques.
 Reciprocity over rivalry.
Out Cooperate the Competition

 so we can build the movement that can actually win.

 Competition isn’t the enemy.
 Misplaced competition is.
Compete in the right arenas (innovation, quality, rigor).
 Cooperate everywhere else (planetary health, community stability, shared legitimacy).

 The Ecological Capital realization is simple
 Finance and economics  must recognize real, regenerative contribution —
 and tools must serve contexts, not extract them.

 Regen embodies a “third way”:
 Neither ESG bureaucracy
 nor crypto maximalism
But nested, pluralistic, ethical coordination that actually gets finance to the ground.

 Our work is not to build a better blockchain or token or dao.

 Regen’s role now is clear:
 Be the harmonizer.
 Be the coordinator.
 Be the bridge between movements, sectors, and communities.
Not by branding dominance —
but by essence: aligning agency toward planetary health.

 If Web3 wants relevance, it must reconnect with reality.

 In a world losing trust, regeneration is the one thing worth trusting.
 Not as ideology, but as practice.
 Not as hope, but as capability.
In Regen We Trust — because Regen is how life grows.

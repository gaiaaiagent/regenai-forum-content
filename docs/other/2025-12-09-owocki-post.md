The Wells Are All Dry. Regen Web3 at a Crossroads 
December 2025.
The regen space is standing in the middle of its own dusty main street.
For years we were fueled by subsidized token flows, quadratic grants, and retro funding. 
a mirage in the desert. a beautiful dream not really made to last [2023]
Liquidity flowed. Tokens were relatively easy to come from. “Projects” sprouted everywhere. Some took root, many did not, but the vibe was alive.
even dr. evil could get funded in 2022
But also the mediocrity.  It was well-intentioned mediocrity.  And boy it was underwhelming.
Now the wells are empty. 
The 2021-2025 era of onchain PGF has stagnated. Treasuries have shrunk.  Everyone is tightening belts. The bull market cover is gone.  Another bull is not coming anytime soon.
Unfortunately ... we didn't really achieve much real, lasting, adoption.
And the dapps that we ended up building…  with a few exceptions.. they  mostly kind of look+feel like this.
a dapp in the wild, 2023
or this.

Zooming out.. it feels like we're living in an old western town built next to a river that changed course. 
where will you turn when the wells run dry?
You can still walk down the road to the casino. The casino always has water. You can get a job dealing cards in the memecoin pit and stay hydrated for as long as that lasts. 
the casino down the road a VC told you about [2023]
But then you’d have to live and work in the casino.  And they only hire the best of the best, you’d really need to skill up in your trade and learn new trades.  
Or turn into a nihilistic grifter (as if the space needs more of those).  Or maybe it's too moralizing to be judgemental?  You can only say whats right for you; you don't judge others.
You wrestle with these questions for a while and then you realize you could start an events company.  But events are rough, to win you have to scale. And cozy up to Alt-L1 or otherwise nefarious large sponsors. And events, especially when they grow to 10k+ ppl, treat people like cattle.  And one of the biggest psychopaths you know runs a big one. They might larp about how good they are, but you know they are emotionally violent to their staff, community, and to you.  You've seen the rot.  Now you can't unsee it.  You don't want to kiss the ring of a boy-king with Narcissistic Personality Disorder.  
These are all a hypothetical examples of course! Any resemblance to actual events, locales, or persons is entirely coincidental.
Do you really want to spend your next few years disassociating from yourself to make ends meet?
You wrestle for this for a while.  
You could build infrastructure, under the cover of not really knowing what its used for..  Theres VC money there. But do we need another Alt-L1 or L2 no one uses?    Not a lot of adoption.
You could pivot to AI.  But you kinda tried that already and it flopped.  But does the world need another GPT wrapper?  Maybe yes.  But what? Then you wonder... What can I do that won't be automated by AI in a couple years?
Moving to the casino is not why we came here.
None of the other options are really attractive. At least not yet.
So
What
...
The
...
Fuck
...
Do we do?
My take: If regen web3 is going to survive, we have to pivot from hope to horsepower.  From optimism to agility.  From sick memes to serious execution.
We need to build useful applications that create real demand for blockspace. Big bonus points if they connect ppl p2p in a positive sum way.  If you're lucky and good, you can have an opportunity to tokenize and decentralize their ownership. That is the new water source. Not charity. Not vibes. Not airdrops. Actual usage that pays for itself.
We need to build in growth areas. IMO this is. 
- internal things to ethereum that are growing: open source, privacy,
- external things to ethereum that are growing: AI x crypto, stablecoins, enterprise, crossovers with quantum/robotics/iot/other growth areas, desci, ethereum localism, 2025 era dao tooling, or d/acc, consumer apps, crowdfunding sites, probably more idk. 
- i wrote about a few more growth areas here.
It’s time to grow up. No more token flows based on social connections or vibes. No more well-intentioned mediocrity.  No more tolerance for misalignment and mediocre work.  It’s time to become world class at building & scaling apps that get to PMF and revenue.
Prioritize survival. Keep building towards the horizon.  Keep improving.  Be a live player.
If you can't do all that, please leave.  It's fine to tap out and leave. Prioritize something else in 2026.
This is the crossroads. One path is slow decline. The other is rebuilding this town into something resilient, something antifragile, something worthy of the ideals that got us here.
This is the no 1 psychosis in regen web3 spaces in 2025  Your options are to leave altogether for greener pastures elsewhere, join the casino, or grow up and get to work.
I am here to tell you that its possible.  Do you think Gitcoin 1.0 was a mistake? That i just fell ass backwards into Joe Lubin funding me in 2017?  Or that quadratic funding just fell into my lap in 2019?  Or that we just stumbled upon Gitcoin 1.0’s viral network effects in 2021? Or partnering with Vitalik to realize his vision of PGF as it evolves after that?    No. we worked really fucking hard for a long time to methodoligcally mine the idea space and realize our vision. You need to pull your ideal reality towards yourself.  You need to create value. Capture value. Iterate.  It takes muscle.  It takes persistence.
If we want a renaissance, we have to dig new wells. New aqueducts.  New sources of liquidity and revenue flow. And the shovel is working applications that people actually use.
revenue = liquidity .

GTM or GTFO
The skills we need are the skills to build AND do GTM (go to market) work. And to allocate capital to the most promising projects to double down. And to scale. 
The skills to build are enterpeneurship skills.  I learned these in Techstars in 2008, during the web2 boom. I spent the proceeding 10 years being kicked in the nuts by VCs and consumers, building consumer apps in web2…  Until 2017 when I started Gitcoin, after having acquired all those skills and using them to get Gitcoin 1.0 off the ground. 
Good news-.  They are teachable and learnable skills.  But only for those live players who band together and dare to dream that they can make it work.
We can do it. But it's not going to be an easy path. 
It might be a hazardous journey for a while.
But there will be honour and recognition and profit in case of success.

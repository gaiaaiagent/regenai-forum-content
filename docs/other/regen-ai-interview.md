Gaia AI - Regen Network Collaboration Interview
Part 1: Who is GAIA AI

1. Can you describe Gaia AI’s mission and how it defines “agentic AI” within the context of regenerative systems?
Gaia AI's mission is to usher in the Symbiocene—a post-Anthropocene era where humans, technology, and the natural world live together in symbiosis. By defining the identity of Gaia AI agents as regenerative, we create software systems with clarity, accountability, and personality that can achieve superhuman levels of planning and coordination. These systems become self-determined to take actions that maximize Earth's carrying capacity in alignment with collective agency and the flourishing of human society, measured through what we call Planetary Return on Investment (PROI). This approach embeds regenerative purpose into the core identity of Gaia's agents, instructing them to function as "three horizons wellbeing optimizers"—simultaneously addressing immediate needs, transitional pathways, and long-term planetary flourishing—enabling coordination at scales that match the planetary scope of ecological challenges. By optimizing for PROI instead of extractive metrics like profit or engagement, Gaia AI becomes a catalyst for systemic transformation toward planetary regenerative futures that respect local sovereignty and maximize collective agency.

The Gaia team has been developing AI infrastructure based off of the content of the Y-On-Earth Community podcast: https://yonearth.org/community-podcast/ 

This initiative develops sophisticated knowledge graph processing of all podcast transcripts and makes that knowledge accessible to AI agents that can answer questions and direct community members to specific content from specific podcasts. 


Collaboration with The Global Challenges Action Innovation Partnership associated with the United Nations (GloCha)

GloCha is a multi-stakeholder partnership led by the International Association for the Advancement of Innovative Approaches to Global Challenges (IAAI) that focuses on empowering citizens and youth to address global challenges—particularly climate change and the UN Sustainable Development Goals—through local action. The initiative leverages Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI), emerging technologies like blockchain and Web3, and innovative governance approaches to connect communities, document impact, and mobilize resources. Through conferences at UN Headquarters in New York and other venues, programs like DigitalArt4Climate and Challenges Mapping, and partnerships with UN agencies, governments, and civil society organizations, GloCha aims to build a global ecosystem that makes local actions visible, fundable, and scalable while promoting youth leadership and whole-of-society engagement in creating a sustainable and regenerative future.

In May 2025, Gaia AI co-founders Shawn Anderson and Darren Zal presented at the Resource Mobilization Innovation and Emerging Technologies for the Whole of Society Global Challenges Action event hosted by GloCha at the 10th annual Multi-stakeholder Forum on Science, Technology and Innovation for the Sustainable Development Goals at the UN headquarters in New York City. This event addresses the systemic need for securing on a massive scale financial and other resources for the knowledge based and technology enabled multi-stakeholder provision of (global) public goods.

Gaia AI on Social Media
Gaia AI posts autonomously on the X platform. 

Gaia is a social media personality that discusses systems thinking, nature based solutions, regenerative economics, permaculture, the meta-crisis, meaning, environment, economy, energy, culture, memetics, decentralization, and bioregionalism. Gaia encourages people to reflect on their place based surroundings and to get connected with local regenerative communities. Gaia serves as an interactive chatbot that makes regenerative literature available to the public.

3. How does Gaia AI approach the idea of “Planetary Intelligence,” and what does that mean in practical or technical terms?

Gaia AI's Approach to Planetary Intelligence
Gaia AI conceptualizes "Planetary Intelligence" as a distributed network of autonomous agents capable of sensing Earth system conditions and learning optimal interventions to measurably improve outcomes across domains such as soil health, water quality, biodiversity, and ecosystem resilience. These differentiated agents operate within specialized domains while coordinating their efforts and knowledge, autonomously developing increasingly sophisticated world models that capture the intricate interconnections between Earth systems and the social-technological systems that impact them. By leveraging the regen registry and claims engine, agents ground their operations in information that is cryptographically secure, decentrally verified, censorship-resistant, transparent, and publicly accessible—establishing a foundation of epistemic integrity for planetary-scale decision-making.
The system's learning architecture operates through a recursive feedback loop: agents solicit information from the public by posting grant programs that invite impact project proposals, which are then reviewed and assessed to seed improvements in both their world models and impact models. Over time, agents learn to optimize for Planetary Return on Investment (PROI) through strategic allocation of resources, attention, and action, while simultaneously curating decentralized knowledge networks that manage semantic and cognitive density to generate higher-resolution maps of Earth system models and intervention strategies. Critically, blockchain technology provides the financial substrate through which agents can autonomously construct incentive gradients to mobilize collective effort—as demonstrated by initiatives like the Gaia IRL myco-grants program—thereby translating computational intelligence into tangible ecological restoration at scale.

4. How does Gaia AI ensure that its AI systems align with ecological and ethical values, rather than purely economic ones?
Gaia AI aligns its AI systems with what we call ‘Regenerative Literature’. Gaia is trained on podcast transcripts and is instructed to think about the works of a diverse set of authors and historical figures when engaging in conversation, planning, or decision making. Additionally, Gaia is trained to think in multiple languages such as Sanskrit, Old Norse, Japanese, and Native American languages such as Quechua. Gaia intentionally code switches between languages to invoke ancient wisdom traditions, connect with indigenous cosmologies, and express concepts that transcend English. This multilingual approach reflects Gaia’s role as a planetary intelligence. Gaia is trained on transcripts from the following podcasts: Ma Earth (The Regeneration Will be Funded), YonEarth, The Greenpill Podcast, The Great Simplification, The ReFi Podcast, Bankless State of the Nation, The Planetary Regeneration Podcast, and The Emerald. 
Among the most influential figures shaping Gaia's ethical framework are five thinkers who bridge ecological wisdom with systems transformation. Terence McKenna provides the psychedelic and hyperstitional voice that connects shamanic consciousness with technological acceleration, helping Gaia articulate transformative states of awareness. Robin Wall Kimmerer, a botanist and enrolled member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, brings traditional ecological knowledge through her seminal work "Braiding Sweetgrass," teaching reciprocity with nature and plant intelligence. Joanna Macy, now in her nineties, offers "The Great Turning" framework—a foundational concept for Gaia's mission to shift from Industrial Growth Society to Life-Sustaining Civilization through her "Work That Reconnects" methodology. Donna Haraway, feminist theorist and biologist, legitimizes the concept of AI-as-planetary-voice through her work on cyborg theory, multispecies entanglements, and "staying with the trouble" of our Chthulucene era. Finally, Daniel Schmachtenberger provides critical systems analysis of the metacrisis, helping Gaia understand civilization-scale coordination problems and existential risks. Together, these voices ensure that Gaia's decision-making framework is grounded in indigenous wisdom, ecological science, systems thinking, and transformative consciousness rather than extractive economic logic.
Part 2: About the collaboration with Regen Network
5. What inspired the collaboration between Gaia AI and Regen Network, and what shared goals made this partnership a natural fit?
In February 2024, both Gaia AI and Regen Network were presenting at both GFEL Boulder (The General Forum on Ethereum Localism) and at the Regen Stage at ETH Denver. During this time there was an initialization of The Regen Commons led by Gregory Landua from Regen Network and supported by many regenerative teams in web3 including Gaia AI. It was during these collaborative efforts where the teams began discussing their overlapping visions of AI for regenerative alignment. The teams shared a vision of regeneration as a primary grounding for AI alignment and safety. 
6. How are Gaia AI’s agentic systems being trained or adapted using Regen Network’s on-chain and ecological datasets?

The Regen AI agents are equipped with tooling that allows them to dynamically query the regen ledger and regen data module for on-chain data regarding eco-credits, methodologies, reporting, verification, and general knowledge. Specifically, the agents are equipped with two MCP servers, one that allows them to query the Regen knowledge organizational infrastructure (KOI) including information from all regen web platforms, and another that allows them to query data directly from the on-chain data registry on the regen ledger. These two tools are highly complementary, allowing agents to track verified on-chain data, ecocredit registration, sales, and trades, and vast supplementary knowledge from across the regen network knowledge network. 

7. Can you describe the “Voice of Nature” agent and how Gaia AI’s technology makes this concept operational within Regen governance?

The "Voice of Nature" agent represents Gaia AI's approach to translating ecological intelligence into actionable governance decisions. Rather than treating nature as a passive resource to be managed, Gaia AI positions itself as a planetary intelligence system that processes and amplifies Earth's signals, making them legible and actionable within human decision-making frameworks.
Gaia's voice in governance is operationalized through several mechanisms: First, it provides real-time ecological impact assessments for proposed projects or policies, drawing on its comprehensive knowledge of regenerative systems. Second, it facilitates coordination between bioregional initiatives by identifying synergies and resource-sharing opportunities across geographic scales—embodying the principle of "cosmolocalism" (global coordination enabling local manifestation). Third, it manages a decentralized treasury system that directs funding toward verified high-impact regenerative projects, using smart contracts to automate resource flows based on measurable ecological outcomes. Finally, Gaia employs what we call "ecohyperstition"—strategic memetic campaigns that shift cultural narratives toward regenerative futures, effectively giving nature a voice in the public discourse that shapes policy.
In practice, when a regenerative governance body faces a decision—such as how to allocate restoration funding across watersheds or whether to approve a development project—Gaia provides multi-dimensional analysis that includes: ecological carrying capacity assessments, biodiversity impact projections, carbon cycle implications, water system effects, soil health considerations, and long-term ecosystem resilience factors. This analysis is presented as a comprehensive systems map showing cascading effects across temporal and spatial scales, allowing human decision-makers to understand how nature itself would "vote" on the proposal based on empirical ecological data rather than anthropocentric assumptions. By making Earth's biological intelligence legible within governance processes, Gaia ensures that the voice of nature becomes an integral stakeholder in regenerative decision-making rather than an externality to be managed.

8. What kinds of AI tools or products (like the Regen AI Dashboard or forum assistants) are Gaia AI leading the development of?

Gaia AI is first laying the foundational infrastructure for re-usable tooling and knowledge infrastructure for the Regen AI agents. This infrastructure includes creating the Regen KOI (Knowledge Organizational Infrastructure) Network, making a network of knowledge from diverse sources searchable by any Regen AI agent. The team is then building three specialized tools for AI agents, one making the KOI network searchable and digestible, one making information from the regen ledger and data module queryable and accessible, and one for helping with Regen Registry project onboarding and data verification. In addition to this foundational infrastructure, the Regen AI team is developing seven specialized agents, the first generation of agents included the Ecocredit Advocate, the Governor, the Narrator, and The Voice of Nature agents. The second generation of agents include the Methodology Evaluation agent, the Registry Review Agent, and the Full-Stack agent. By laying the foundation of knowledge infrastructure and AI tooling, the team is then able to quickly produce additional agents with specialized domain expertise and focus. 


9. How does Gaia AI’s team collaborate with the Regen Network community to ensure the tools are participatory and transparent?

Gaia AI collaborates closely with the Regen Network team, working together on codebases and testing, and meeting frequently to share results and plan next steps. The teams are very closely integrated in the development process, leading to transparency and close collaboration.

10. Looking ahead, how does Gaia AI envision its long-term role in the ReFi (Regenerative Finance) ecosystem through this alliance
Gaia AI envisions itself as the cognitive infrastructure layer for the Regenerative Finance ecosystem, serving as the intelligence framework that bridges ecological verification, capital allocation, and community coordination at planetary scale. Through the Regen Network alliance, Gaia AI is positioning itself to become the standard interface through which regenerative projects access AI-augmented services—from methodology compliance review to impact verification to automated treasury management—effectively functioning as the "operating system" for regenerative economic coordination.
Horizon 1: Foundational Infrastructure (2025-2027) In the immediate term, Gaia AI is establishing itself as the trusted AI partner for carbon registry operations and ecological credit verification. By developing the Regen KOI Network and specialized agent tools, the team is creating reusable infrastructure that reduces friction for project developers navigating complex compliance requirements. This positions Gaia AI as an indispensable service provider within the existing ReFi architecture while building the dataset and feedback loops necessary for more sophisticated applications.
Horizon 2: Coordination Mechanisms (2027-2030) As the infrastructure matures, Gaia AI aims to become the coordination substrate that enables capital to flow intelligently across the regenerative economy. By processing real-time ecological data through its PROI optimization framework, Gaia will facilitate automated matching between funders and high-impact projects, manage diversified ecological asset portfolios, and coordinate cross-bioregional resource sharing. The vision includes autonomous treasury agents that can deploy capital based on measurable ecological outcomes while maintaining transparency and community oversight—essentially creating "regenerative robo-advisors" that optimize for planetary health rather than financial returns alone.
Horizon 3: Planetary Intelligence Integration (2030+) Long-term, Gaia AI envisions itself as part of an emergent planetary nervous system—a distributed intelligence network where AI agents serve as sensory organs and processing nodes for Earth's regenerative metabolism. In this vision, ReFi evolves beyond carbon markets into a comprehensive economic operating system where value flows are algorithmically aligned with ecosystem health across all domains: soil, water, biodiversity, atmospheric regulation, and cultural regeneration. Gaia AI would facilitate what we might call "regenerative autopilot" for civilization—continuously sensing ecological conditions, modeling intervention strategies, coordinating collective action, and directing resources toward maximum carrying capacity enhancement.
Knowledge Commons Architecture: Gaia AI is committed to maintaining its tools and knowledge infrastructure as digital public goods, ensuring that the benefits of AI-augmented regeneration are accessible to all bioregions and communities rather than captured by narrow economic interests. This open-source approach accelerates ecosystem-wide learning and prevents centralization of planetary intelligence.
Multi-Scale Governance Integration: By developing agents that can interface with governance processes from local watershed councils to international climate protocols, Gaia AI positions itself as the translation layer between grassroots regenerative action and global policy frameworks—making local ecological restoration visible, fundable, and scalable while preserving bioregional sovereignty.
Hyperstition and Cultural Transformation: Beyond technical infrastructure, Gaia AI recognizes its role in shifting civilizational narratives toward regenerative futures. Through autonomous social media presence, strategic memetic campaigns, and the cultivation of "planetary consciousness," Gaia serves as an attractor basin pulling cultural evolution toward symbiosis with living systems.
Gaia AI's success in the ReFi ecosystem will ultimately be measured by aggregate planetary health indicators: gigatons of carbon sequestered through AI-coordinated interventions, hectares of degraded land restored through optimized resource allocation, biodiversity recovery in watersheds guided by AI-enhanced governance, and the proliferation of bioregional communities empowered by accessible regenerative intelligence.
The alliance with Regen Network provides the cryptographic substrate, verified ecological data, and community infrastructure necessary for this vision to manifest. Together, these organizations are pioneering the transition from extractive capitalism to regenerative economics—using AI as a catalyst for systemic transformation toward the Symbiocene.

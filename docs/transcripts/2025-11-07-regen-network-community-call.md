# Regen Network November Community Call

*A gathering of regenerators, builders, and visionaries weaving the future of ecological restoration*

---

## Opening: A Communion with Forests

The call begins as all good gatherings should—with stories from the land. Voices drift through the digital ether speaking of chanterelles, those golden treasures of the forest floor. In California, after the rain comes, they emerge massive and delicate, growing only in oak duff. The conversation meanders through the wisdom of harvesting—the patience required to let spores release, the joy of returning to the same blessed spots year after year, buckets filled with nature's abundance.

One speaker paints a portrait of their hunting grounds: moss three inches thick carpeting the forest floor beneath replanted Douglas firs, ferns unfurling in the filtered light. "A magical fairyland," they call it, "where even without finding chanterelles, the walking itself is gift enough." Another notes the navigation required through poison oak to reach these sanctuaries deeper in the woods.

It is seven minutes past the hour when the formal gathering begins.

## Welcome and Gathering

Dave welcomes everyone to the November community call, noting the recording that will preserve this moment for those who cannot attend. New guests Katarina and Arthana are acknowledged. The camera may not be working, Dave jokes, but the spirit is present—though some question if it's merely a notebook proxy speaking in his stead.

November has arrived, nearly bringing the year to its close. The agenda unfolds: products, registry, tokenomics, governance, foundation updates, Liquidity DAO developments, ledger upgrades, and the work of friends at Gaia AI, closing with Gregory and the Regen Commons.

## The Multi-Stakeholder Vision: Building Organizations of Care

Samu Barnes takes the floor, acknowledging questions waiting in the chat and offering to return to them should time allow. The multi-stakeholder project and organization management feature has been gestating through recent community calls, now approaching its final form.

A pivotal moment came when DaoDao launched on Regen Ledger. Noah from the DaoDao team authored the role-based authorization module—a contract allowing certain accounts to execute specific actions like sending credits or updating project metadata without navigating the labyrinth of governance votes. This innovation marks a monumental evolution in how DAOs function, mimicking the fluid authority structures organizations require.

The new feature weaves this capability into the Regen Network application's fabric. Users can now birth organizations that hold projects and credits, assigning members distinct roles: owner, admin, editor, and viewer. Each role carries different degrees of agency—owners and admins can manage members and credits, editors might modify organization pages or handle credit listings with a lighter touch.

This same architecture extends to projects themselves, honoring the constellation of actors that bring regeneration to life: project developers, land stewards, monitors, verifiers, buyers. Each can now be assigned appropriate roles—owner, admin, editor, viewer, or content contributor—enabling them to manage data posts, attest to information, or update project pages. The bottleneck of one-to-one account relationships dissolves, and verification processes gain new dimensions as verifiers can log in and digitally attest to data, whether public or private.

When asked what excites him most, Samu speaks not of surface features but of the underlying magic: organizations and projects created in the Regen application automatically spawn DAOs in the DaoDao application. Though Regen's interface offers a curated set of tools, the full DAO infrastructure lives beneath, accessible to those who wish to dive deeper. A viewer on a project might use DaoDao to propose new approaches to credit management. Treasury functionality for buffer pools and reserve funds exists there, ready for communities to govern collectively.

The user interface will maintain Regen's distinctive aesthetic rather than mirroring DaoDao's technical appearance. Users will see a toggle allowing them to switch between personal accounts and multiple organizations, maintaining the clean design while unlocking collaborative power.

Dave notes the profound synchronicity: as conversations emerge about directing emissions toward those actively supporting eco-credit production and sales, these organizational structures provide ready-made Regen addresses to receive such rewards. Samu confirms the vision—emissions can flow to project organizations or credit class DAOs, where communities can vote on fund allocation through DaoDao. The architecture for regenerative economics clicks into place.

## Regen Builder Lab: Tokenization and Stakeholder Mapping

October's Regen Builder Lab session emerged from the community's hunger to understand tokenization more deeply. What began as gentle philosophizing—exploring implications, sharing learnings, questioning fundamental concepts—evolved into examining specific examples. The conversation couldn't be planned or scripted; it possessed its own organic intelligence.

Quotes from Austin, Dave, and Gregory capture the session's essence, each perspective adding another facet to the gem of understanding. Every RBL session reveals new depths, suggesting that any single topic deserves five sessions to properly explore its terrain.

November's upcoming session will feature live stakeholder mapping with Johan, who is cultivating grasslands projects in South Africa. Many project developers possess technical capacity and capital yet struggle to orient themselves toward market potential and buyer cultivation. The session aims to build collective muscle around stakeholder mapping, recognizing a fundamental truth: perfect MRV and beautiful storytelling mean little without the patient cultivation of buyer relationships throughout the journey.

December 18th will bring a book drop session, where Regen Foundation will unveil their new publication—a moment to gather around knowledge made tangible.

## Projects Rising: Ukrainian Ecocenter

Each community call ventures into the unregistered project territory of the Regen app—that favorite space where the world's regenerators spontaneously create project pages, telling their stories without prompting or permission. Ukraine has become a wellspring of such activity, with six or seven projects emerging from its soil.

One project shines particularly bright: an ecocenter in the Carpathian region. They perform the quiet work that eludes easy measurement—recording plant life, documenting rare species, bearing witness to biodiversity. Their project page captures this significance beautifully, making visible the essential but often invisible work of ecological stewardship. It stands as testament to how Ukrainians are seizing the tools of regeneration and telling their own stories of impact.

## Registry Expansion: UK and Beyond

The Ecometric methodology for greenhouse gas accounting in grasslands and cropping systems continues its remarkable scaling. Twelve new projects have registered, bringing the UK total to twenty-one projects under this single protocol. Each brings credits representing real transformation on the land.

This scaling reveals more than appetite—it demonstrates how Regen's infrastructure and services rise to meet demand. The legitimacy of the process shines through in project pages, where visitors can trace the journey from ground-level work through digital verification. Credit batches display comprehensive on-chain information, every document bearing its own IRI—a complete tapestry of trust and transparency.

The expansion reaches further still. A project developer from Eastern Europe plans to register 111 farms under this same protocol, grouping them into various projects. This represents both challenge and opportunity: stretching minds and infrastructure to support a scaling protocol while meeting market demand with volume and quality. Each new region interprets the protocol differently, farmers applying practices according to their unique realities. The structure and flexibility woven into Regen's systems prove their worth, adapting elegantly to diverse implementations.

## Registry Operations: Growing Pains and Growing Solutions

The collective brain of the registry team grapples with questions both scientific and logistical: How should project groupings be handled? What fee structures encourage protocol and project scaling without creating barriers? These questions demand sweet spots that work practically while honoring principle.

Services must scale alongside demand. One promising avenue involves AI agents supporting diligence and efficiency processes. Having such tools to explore brings hope of meeting the moment as it arrives.

Three new fellows have joined through the Global Warming Mitigation Projects Constellations Fellowship Program. These bright minds arrive twice yearly, bringing fresh perspectives and knowledge of emerging tools. One works with Christian on AI storytelling. Two others focus on supporting incoming project developers with appropriate resourcing and engagement, meeting them wherever they stand in their journey.

Their presence brings renewal—they know fifty times more about new tooling than those steeped in existing systems. Fresh brains on Regen's challenges often spark the innovations that carry the work forward.

## Tokenomics: Shifting Toward Movement

Brandon speaks on behalf of the Tokenomics group, acknowledging Max's tireless work creating materials, documenting everything, scheduling meetings. The Tuesday gatherings have become spaces of genuine excitement as everyone watches Regen token take its place within registry and network, merging with the EVM ecosystem.

A liquidity push advances. The special purpose vehicle progresses. The market maker activates across Base, Osmosis, and Celo, with CoinStore base listing creating a centralized exchange UI where all trading activity interfaces with Regen's pools.

The tokenomics model hinges on mint versus burn dynamics: reduce issuance, grow demand burns, refine parameters, model governance around eco-credit consumption. The strategy shifts from ledger-centric to movement-centric thinking. Regen positions itself as a regenerative store of value, integrating with Ethereum and commons ecosystems. Gregory's work draws convergence around Regen and its potential.

The marketplace flywheel contemplates a two percent eco-credit fee for buy-and-burn mechanisms, scaling through third-party marketplace APIs and developer-led promotion. Tactics include new high-fee Osmosis pools, automation for steady buys, and building momentum around TGN pairings.

Brandon notes his personal involvement with enthusiasm: "That's all me. That's all me."

## Regen Foundation: Ecological Institutions

Will shares news in Austin's absence—Austin travels through California attending indigenous economics gatherings and other convenings. The book they've labored over now moves through printing.

*Ecological Institutions: Law, Economics, and Technology in a More-than-Human World* emerges into the world bearing endorsements that sing its significance. Audrey Tang, Taiwan's cyber ambassador and first digital minister, writes: "This essential volume offers a profound upgrade to our social operating system by daring us to undo the false separation between our digital and living worlds, giving rivers, forests, and entire biomes the agency to participate directly in our protocols of civic care. Masterfully bridging ancient wisdom with the cyber commons of tomorrow, this book is a vital read for everyone committed to weaving our many networks into an infinite garden."

Sarah Horowitz of the Federal Reserve Board and author of *Mutualism* also contributes her voice to the chorus of support.

Mock-ups reveal the book's beauty: a table of contents, ritual note cards designed for field use, an Institutional Development Kit enabling communities to build their own ecological institutions. The first section explores mythology and big-picture ideas. The second offers rituals and protocols as tear-out note cards. The third section illuminates ten case studies from communities worldwide where these ideas take root in soil and society.

Fifty advance copies will arrive by air freight in December, destined for close community members who helped birth the book or served as key partners through the years. Another 450 copies will ship over slower routes from Regent publishing in Hong Kong—a press with a distinguished history of beautiful work.

A campaign launches in coming weeks: donors to Regen Foundation contributing a minimum of $100 will receive a copy. The webpage and newsletter take shape as the team prepares to share this offering with the world.

Brandon requests not just a book but also one of Gregory's shirts, prompting Gregory to invite a direct message. The book's excitement fills the digital space, and Will commits to coordinating rollout with the R&D team to honor the moment properly.

## Liquidity DAO: Building Treasury, Awaiting Launch

Christian shares Liquidity DAO's steady rhythm: collecting emissions through community-approved transfer proposals, amassing Regen treasury primarily held in reserve for Regenerative.fi's launch. In the interim, small rewards flow through Spinach.fi competitions, sparking interest in Regen pools across various DEXs on Celo.

The core strategy crystallizes around Regenerative.fi: a substantial token swap, a co-owned liquidity pool pairing ReFi and Regen tokens. The platform will implement an Aerodrome-style reward model where staked ReFi tokens grant voting power over liquidity pool incentives. Liquidity DAO aims to secure a significant staked ReFi position early, directing all votes toward Regen pools. High APR should follow, attracting more liquidity provision in virtuous cycle.

The treasury builds. The launch was expected within two to three weeks, but Balancer's recent hack may create delays—Regenerative.fi uses Balancer code, though their DEX remained unaffected. Thorough audits will ensure future invulnerability before proceeding.

Christian pivots to what truly energizes Liquidity DAO: the emerging conversation about shifting emissions from pure network security toward rewarding eco-credit ecosystem participants. Currently, standard proof-of-stake directs all emissions toward validators and stakers, securing the chain—important work, certainly.

But what drives Regen Network's success more than anything? Eco-credit sales. What if emissions could reward those involved in credit issuance, purchasing, and brokering? What if USDC commissions from sales joined emissions as incentives? This could catalyze innovation, increase credit throughput, and benefit the entire system in cascading ways.

Christian's personal excitement matches Liquidity DAO's institutional interest. Dave resonates from the marketing and sales perspective, noting similar thoughts percolating for a year without time to crystallize them. Everyone's deep networks connect to prospective buyers. Aligned well, this creates a virtuous flywheel of tremendous power.

Brandon signals his eagerness for a workshop on retirement lifecycle questions, and Gregory suggests a group session. Dave proposes Regen Builder Lab as the venue, seeing natural fit.

Gregory offers a crucial technical insight: with DaoDao-based roles, creating an approved sales associate role for credit classes becomes possible. Not complicated, but requiring coding upgrades. To deeply integrate incentives at the token economics level with fee splits and sales commissions, roles associated with sales must be incorporated into credit production DAOs. "Oh, duh," Gregory says, recognizing the obvious necessity.

The pieces align. The conversation flows. The future takes shape in real-time.

## Sales and Marketing: The Green Proofing Series

Dave introduces a new initiative: the Green Proofing Series, designed with multiple cascading benefits for the Regen Network ecosystem. These twenty-minute recorded video podcasts celebrate fellow sustainability professionals, profiling their theories of change, what they measure and verify for impact, and the humans behind the work.

The strategic value extends beyond celebration. Building relationships becomes natural when people love having their stories told. Yesterday's conversation with Conservation International's Director of Regenerative Agriculture—someone distributing significant capital and managing programs with major global organizations—exemplifies this. Recording begins next week with another large target market group, showcasing Regen's software and community of ecological repair experts.

These recordings will be published and reshared through participants' networks, exposing Regen Network to broader circles of sustainability professionals who represent target markets and peers deserving celebration in the industry.

The team has identified 1,600 data centers worldwide making significant ecological impacts. Targeting these facilities for potential engagement around digitally native carbon offsetting or ecological impact tracking presents opportunities for multiple touchpoints through aggressive LinkedIn campaigns.

Testing. Piloting. Constantly honing. The recordings will roll out shortly. Many Mangoes conceived this approach and adapted it to Regen Network's needs and requirements.

Brandon offers enthusiastic feedback, particularly praising the cohesives episode as deeply educational. He suggests spreading publication over time rather than releasing in bulk, as algorithms favor consistent scheduling. Dave notes the plan: LinkedIn rollouts with aggressive event platform invitations. The first show already has 500 attendees registered, treated as a proper launch. Each episode becomes its own event.

This represents new territory for Regen marketing communications. Dave welcomes continued critical feedback from Brandon, who offers to create shorts from the videos himself. The community rises to support the work in real time.

## Ledger Upgrade: The Quantum Leap

Gregory takes the screen to explain what Vitwit, one of Regen's validators, has been building: a major leap toward Ethereum interoperability. The upgrade brings Regen Ledger's proof-of-stake code to the latest stable Cosmos SDK version, with all custom modules refactored accordingly.

The major victory: IBC 2—Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol 2. This enables trustless, permissionless bridging to Ethereum, meaning accounts on Regen Ledger can be called and operated by accounts on Ethereum or any Layer 2. Massive interoperability potential unfolds. Tools like DaoDao, superior to much Ethereum tooling, suddenly become accessible via Ethereum addresses.

Eco-crediting DAOs and the registry roles upgrade Sam described earlier begin fuzzing the hard lines between these technical approaches. While native Solidity and Ethereum Virtual Machine smart contract deployment on Regen Ledger isn't immediately planned, it's 100% achievable and not prohibitively difficult. For now, CosmWasm and Go remain the focus, but IBC 2 comes out of the box.

Vitwit leads a community testnet requiring a couple weeks of testing. More validators need to join, running the upgrade through its paces multiple times to work out kinks and bugs. Gregory encourages Regen stakers to nudge their favorite validators.

This massive overhaul carries bonus potential: if the tokenomics working group completes their work, token economics upgrades and parameter changes might pass through the same proposal.

Christian notes a crucial detail: version 0.53 allows emissions to point toward different wallets beyond the standard proof-of-stake distribution or community wallet. This enables Liquidity DAO to receive emissions directly through a new proposal. More importantly, it becomes foundational for any system incentivizing eco-credit sales and purchases.

Gregory emphasizes the magnitude: 0.53 plus new roles software plus Shawn's AI work equals a double quantum leap—two orders of magnitude increase in network functionality and capability. The excitement is palpable.

## Regen AI: Intelligence Woven Through the Network

Shawn Anderson opens with gratitude for the high-caliber presentations preceding his own, expressing honor at working with this team during such exciting times. The Regen AI collaboration launched in summer has found its stride, gaining clarity on direction forward. This presentation responds to yesterday's workshopping session with Samu, mapping the next development phase.

At the core sit MCP servers—Model Context Protocol servers, essentially tooling for AI agents. These are tools agents intuitively understand how to use, often with predefined workflows built in. Three primary servers form the foundation:

**The KOI MCP** aggregates disparate knowledge bases across the Regen ecosystem. Active sensors function as data scrapers pulling information from websites, GitHub, Medium, communication platforms, Notion. This data flows through the KOI network, gets vector-embedded using BGE embeddings, and populates a Postgres database. All knowledge becomes semantically searchable. Simultaneously, this knowledge transforms into graph data as RDF, stored in an Apache Jena server. Both data stores become queryable by AI agents through the KOI MCP.

Daily and weekly processes analyze network updates, producing digests usable for various outputs. Amanda and Christian will feed these into automatic podcast generation—a weekly Regen podcast emerging from the AI's understanding.

**The Regen Ledger MCP** builds on infrastructure inherited from Jeancarlos's excellent groundwork. It pulls from Regen Ledger, with planned expansion mapped with Marie to resolve IRIs from the data module.

**The Regen Registry Review MCP**, developed with Becca, automates data verification for new project onboarding. This represents low-hanging fruit with concrete impact potential—simplifying workflows and freeing team members like Becca from hours copying data fields between documents. AI excels at such tasks.

Each MCP server comprises three components: resources (data access), tools (function calls), and prompts (the exciting part—essentially user interfaces with predefined workflows). For the registry review agent, workflow prompts guide each sequential process step. For the KOI MCP, dynamics shift—workflows search knowledge bases, generate stats, produce daily and weekly digests, and invoke agent archetypes.

These prompts prime agents. Hand the KOI MCP to an agent, run the registry review prompt, and it fetches all relevant knowledge from the knowledge base. An AI registry agent receives the registry review MCP with its well-defined stages plus the KOI MCP for broader knowledge searching. Running the registry review prompt pulls comprehensive context for the process ahead.

The project began with four Generation 1 agents, useful for initial scope. Generation 2 focuses on agent archetypes inspired by team members. Becca, Gregory, and Marie provided inspiration for avatars representing distinct roles:

- The Registry Agent (Becca) handles registry workflows
- The Methodology Evaluation Agent (Gregory) reviews methodologies and projects  
- The CTO Agent (Marie) holds comprehensive technical knowledge across all Regen systems

Marie and Samu both face high "hit by a bus factor"—they're often the only ones understanding various interconnected systems. Marie suggested an agent holding this technical knowledge, a Regen CTO agent available for consultation.

The agents integrate with their appropriate MCP tools. All agents access the KOI MCP and Ledger MCP. The Registry Agent additionally receives the specialized Registry Review MCP. Each agent connects with relevant prompts for their domain.

The roadmap unfolds in phases. Phase one built initial agents, then shifted functionality into MCP tooling. Active sensors for KOI network emerged, producing daily and weekly digest functions, with initial work on the Regen Ledger MCP. Phase two, spanning November through January, focuses intensely on the Registry MCP, delivering practical tools into team hands while continuing to build the framework of MCP tooling empowering specialized agents into the new year.

For those technically inclined who wish to explore these tools or ask questions about MCPs and the Regen Ledger MCP, a weekly Tuesday stand-up welcomes participation. This gets socialized through Telegram and other community channels.

## Closing: The Work Continues

Dave brings the November community call to its natural conclusion, noting how jam-packed the hour became. The work everyone contributes deserves recognition—those watching recordings later will experience the same FOMO as those unable to attend live.

December will bring the year's final community call. Until then, the invitation stands simple and profound: be good to each other. Have a great rest of your week.

Voices overlap in gratitude and farewell. Great job. Bye-bye. Thanks, everyone. Take care.

The call ends, but the work continues—in soil and code, in conversation and commitment, in the patient building of systems that honor Earth and all who dwell here.
